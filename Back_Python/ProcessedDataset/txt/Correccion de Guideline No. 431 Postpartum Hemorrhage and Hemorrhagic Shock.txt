The authors regret that there is a typo on page 1302 in Table 6 (under the Carboprost column in the Repeat dosing
row). The information in the cell was input as “Every 15 min  max 5 doses ”but it should be “Every 15 min  max 8
doses ”.
The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.DOI of original article: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2022.10.002
