They are based on the FIGO Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee (SMNH) guidelines that were published in 20121 and include research and consensus guide- lines. For the present document a bibliographic review was performed and studies from LMICs and across regions were identified using the search engines PubMed Medline Embase Science Direct and Google Scholar. According to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation) approach this update does not generate a universal level of evidence. However each section and the generated conclusions and recommendations use the degrees of evidence that were identified in the bibliographic review. REFERENCE 1. Lalonde A.

Its mission statement re - flects a commitment to promoting health human rights and well-  being of all women especially those at the most significant risk of death and disability associated with childbearing. FIGO provides evidence- based interventions that can reduce the incidence of maternal morbidity and mortality when applied with informed consent. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) continues to be the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in most countries around the world. Despite multiple collaborative efforts at all levels there is still a lack of implementation or adherence to the recommendations for management of PPH when faced with this obstetric emergency. In part this delay in implementation lies in the lack of information from current evidence and a lack of unification of the multiple guidelines for diagnosis and strat - egies to control bleeding. To provide clear and practical tools to approach this obstetric emergency especially for low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) the FIGO Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee (SMNH) supported by a group of experts worldwide developed this updated review. It aims to provide multiple alternatives for the diagnosis and management of PPH tailored to the resources available at the institutional  local or regional level. This document reflects the best available evidence drawn from scientific literature and expert opinion on the prevention and treatment of PPH in low- resource settings. FIGO believes that the greatest impediment in the adoption of a given strategy is the absence of an effective implementation tool. 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

All attempts should be made to reduce PPH using cost- effective resource- appropriate interventions. At first all should be done to avoid PPH and re - duce the need for expensive lifesaving surgical interventions. The routine use of active management of the third stage of labor by all attendants regardless of where they practice should be rec - ommended.2 All birth attendants must know how to provide safe care (physiologic management) to prevent PPH in the absence of uterotonic drugs.3 2.1  |  FIGO recommendations for prevention of postpartum hemorrhage 1. The use of uterotonics for prevention of PPH during the third stage of labor is recommended for all births.4 5 Oxytocin (10 IU intravenously/intramuscularly [IV/IM]) is recommended for the prevention of PPH for vaginal delivery and cesarean section.4 5 In settings where oxytocin is used attention should be paid to the oxytocin cold chain.6 2. In settings where oxytocin is unavailable or its quality can- not be guaranteed the use of other injectable uterotonics (if appropriate ergometrine/methylergometrine 200 μg IM/IV;  hypertensive disorders can be safely excluded prior to its use) or oral misoprostol (400–600 µg orally) or carbetocin 100 µg IM/IV is recommended for the prevention of PPH.4 5 3. The combinations of ergometrine plus oxytocin or misoprostol plus oxytocin may be more effective uterotonic drug strategies for the prevention of PPH ≥500 ml compared with the current standard  oxytocin. This comes at the expense of a higher risk of adverse ef - fects (vomiting and hypertension with ergometrine and fever with misoprostol).7 4. In settings where skilled birth attendants are not present to ad - minister injectable uterotonics and oxytocin is unavailable the administration of misoprostol (400– 600 μ g orally) by community healthcare workers and lay health workers is recommended for the prevention of PPH.4 5 5. In settings where skilled birth attendants are unavailable con - trolled cord traction (CCT) is not recommended.4 6. Sustained uterine massage is not recommended as an interven - tion to prevent PPH in women who have received prophylactic oxytocin.8 7. Postpartum abdominal uterine tonus assessment for early identi - fication of uterine atony is recommended for all women.4 8. Oxytocin (IV or IM) and CCT is the recommended method for removal of the placenta for the prevention of PPH in cesarean delivery.42.2  |  FIGO recommendations for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage 1. Intravenous oxytocin alone is the recommended first- line uterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH.3 4 2. If intravenous oxytocin is unavailable or if the bleeding does not respond to oxytocin the use of intramuscular er - gometrine oxytocin– ergometrine fixed dose or a prosta - glandin drug (including sublingual misoprostol 800 μg) is recommended.3 4 9 10 3. There is no evidence about the safety and efficacy of an additional 800- μg dose of misoprostol for treatment of PPH when given to women who have already received 600 μg of prophylactic misopros - tol orally. 4. The use of isotonic crystalloids is recommended in preference to the use of colloids for the initial intravenous fluid resuscitation of women with PPH.4 11 5. Early use of intravenous tranexamic acid as soon as PPH is diag - nosed but within 3 h of birth in addition to standard care is rec - ommended for women with clinically diagnosed PPH following vaginal birth or cesarean delivery.12– 14 6. Administration of 1 g (100 mg/ml) tranexamic acid intravenously at 1 ml/min (i.e. administered over 10 min) with a second dose of 1 g in - travenously if bleeding continues after 30 min or if bleeding restarts within 24 h of completing the first dose. Reducing maternal deaths due to bleeding through scaling up of tranexamic acid for PPH treat - ment could have a positive impact on health equity and improve out - comes among disadvantaged women especially in LMICs.15 7. Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH.3 4 8. The use of bimanual uterine compression or external aortic compression for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth is recommended as a temporizing measure until ap - propriate care is available.3 4 9. If women do not respond to treatment using uterotonics or if uterotonics are unavailable the use of uterine balloon tam - ponade is recommended as an effective nonsurgical technique that can potentially improve survival in women with PPH due to uterine atony after ruling out retained products of conception or uterine rupture as a contributing factor.3 4 16 10. Use of the nonpneumatic antishock garment is recommended as a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available.3 4 11. The use of uterine packing is not recommended for the treat - ment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth.3 4 12. Uterine artery embolization can be another conservative man - agement measure for PPH if technical conditions and skilled human resources are available for its use.17 13. If bleeding does not stop despite treatment using uterotonics and other available conservative interventions (e.g. uterine mas - sage balloon tamponade) the use of surgical interventions is recommended.3 4 Surgical interventions include the use of com - pression suture techniques 18 uterine and hypogastric artery li - gation and hysterectomy. 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

The priority is to stop the bleeding before the patient develops coagulation problems and organ damage from under- perfusion. Conservative approaches should be tried first rapidly moving to more invasive procedures if these do not work. REFERENCES 1. World Health Organization. WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.

This document will update the recommendations and discuss new approaches. 3.3  |  Definition of postpartum hemorrhage The lack of consistency in the definition of PPH has been a major limitation to the ability to compare prevalence in different stud - ies (Table 2). Classically it was defined as quantified bleeding of more than 500 ml for vaginal deliveries and more than 1000 ml for cesarean deliveries occurring within the first 24 h of delivery.1 However this definition did not focus on clinical signs and symp - toms of hemorrhage and thus prevented early detection in many cases. Therefore in 2017 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) changed the definition to blood loss of more than or equal to 1000 ml or blood loss that was accompanied by signs or symptoms of hypovolemia occurring within 24 h after birth regardless of the mode of delivery.6 In contrast the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) defines PPH according to the volume of blood lost: minor (between 500 and 1000 ml) and major ( >1000 ml).7 However the volume of estimated blood loss remains unreliable in many cases and therefore much attention should be directed to the general clinical status of the patient instead.8 Several tools for assessment of blood loss have been used as accurate estimation will directly influence the diag - nosis and management of PPH. Many groups cite visual estimation as part of blood loss assessment but as it has high potential to un - derestimate hemorrhage use of additional tools for more objective estimation such as gravimetric measurement direct blood collec - tion techniques and evaluation of clinical parameters have been proposed.9– 17 Recently some guidelines have incorporated the shock index9 11 14 17 and obstetric early warning systems into their recommendations to evaluate bleeding.11 14 17 3.4  |  Etiologies/risk factors While there exist several identifiable risk factors for PPH most cases occur unexpectedly.6 18 An easy way to remember the most common etiologies is to remember the four T’s19: TABLE 1  FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage FIGO recommendation Year References Management of the third stage of labor to prevent post- partum hemorrhage2003 International Confederation of Midwives; International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians.

These initiatives that involve multiple intervention points and actors have been called “bundles” or intervention packages which consist of the implementation of a group of interventions as well as multi - disciplinary programs that standardize and comprehensively address the management of pathologies.1– 6 Bundles represent a selection of existing guidelines and recommendations in a form that aids system - atic implementation and a consistency of practice. The California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) Working Group on obstetrical hemorrhage developed the Improving the Health Care Response to Obstetric Bleeding Toolkit in 2010 to help obstetric providers clinical staff hospitals and healthcare organizations develop methods within their facility for timely rec - ognition and an organized and rapid response to bleeding. In March 2015 version 2.0 was updated with the latest evidence- based changes.6 In 2015 work groups of the National Partnership for Maternal Safety — within the Council on Patient Safety in Women's Health Care that represents all major women's healthcare professional or - ganizations in the USA — developed an obstetric hemorrhage safety bundle. The goal of the partnership was the adoption of the safety bundle by every birthing facility. This consensus bundle is organized into four action domains: readiness; recognition and prevention; re- sponse; and reporting and systems learning. There are 13 key ele - ments within these four action domains (Table 3). In 2017 the World Health Organization (WHO) carried out a technical consultation among international maternal health experts to evaluate the development of care bundles for PPH. A total of 730 TABLE 3  Obstetric hemorrhage safety bundle action domains from the National Partnership for Maternal Safety Council on Patient Safety in Women's Healtha Domain Key elements Readiness (Every Unit) 1. Hemorrhage cart with supplies checklist and instruction cards for uterine balloon tamponade and compression sutures. 2. Immediate access to hemorrhage medications (kit or equivalent). 3. A response team to call when help is needed (blood bank advanced gynecologic surgery other support and tertiary services). 4. Massive and emergency- release transfusion protocols (type- O negative or uncross- matched). 5. Unit education on protocols unit- based drills (with post drill debriefs). Recognition and Prevention (Every Patient) 1. Assessment of hemorrhage risk (prenatal on admission and at other appropriate times). 2.

The consultation led to a definition of two care bundles which are summarized in Table 4. The first response PPH bundle must be implemented at both the primary healthcare and hospital levels. The discussion about the re - sponse to refractory PPH bundle raised some controversy. For the first response PPH bundle the next phase is the development of an implementation strategy culminating in a model for use at the facility level in LMICs. For the response to refractory PPH bundle it is a priority to solve pending controversies including the operational definition of refractory PPH and to better understand the effective - ness of various uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) devices.REFERENCES 1.

Insufficient blood flow may be clinically identified as the develop - ment of one or more of the following: lactic acidosis altered men - tal status oliguria and tachycardia. Vital signs monitoring is key to hemodynamic assessment and prompt intervention.1 In healthy pregnant and postpartum women cardiologic physiologic com - pensatory mechanisms prevent changes in vital signs until a large volume of blood has been lost (usually > 1000 ml). Hence changes in clinical and vital signs that result from hemorrhage appear late in the process and may not lead to early identification of PPH. This in turn makes it difficult to establish cutoff points to trigger clinical interventions. Moreover because traditional vital signs change late and are less reliable as triggers for clinical actions  other indicators could help to characterize maternal hypovolemia caused by bleeding.2 Although the use of conventional individual vital signs (pulse and systolic blood pressure) may lack accuracy in the assessment of hypotension a simple combination of both may transform routine clinical parameters into a more accurate indica - tor of hypovolemia such as the shock index (SI). SI is defined as the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure.3 4 The SI may im - prove the predictive capability of individual clinical signs which aids early identification of women at risk of hypovolemia as the result of obstetric causes.5 Moreover the SI has been proposed as a reliable indicator of adverse maternal outcomes 6 and its val - ues have been set to indicate clinical management.7 However the association between shock parameters and advanced treatment modalities in severe PPH has yet to be reported. 5.1  |  Assessment of circulating blood volume in postpartum hemorrhage The essential cornerstone of management of PPH involves prompt diagnosis and rapid replacement of lost blood volume as well as the oxygen- carrying capacity of blood accompanied by immediate medical and surgical measures to address the underlying cause(s)  and hence prevent more loss. To assess the patient's condition SI has been introduced as a simple and clinically effective vital sign. The SI has been shown to have an inverse linear relation - ship with left ventricular stroke work in acute circulatory failure. Therefore a concurrent reduction of left ventricular stroke work (induced by hemorrhage trauma or sepsis) was associated with an elevation of the SI and a deterioration in left ventricular mechanical performance. Poor left ventricular function or persistent abnormal elevation of the SI after aggressive therapy and hemodynamic sta - bilization was associated with increased mortality in critically ill  traumatized patients.8 In obstetric and nonobstetric circumstances  the absence of a significant drop in blood pressure in patients with PPH may mask the actual hypovolemic status due to physiological compensatory mechanisms.9 For that reason the SI was the only promising marker that indicated the severity of blood loss.2 5 The SI together with the rule of 30 are important tools that may aid clinicians in an emergency to determine the amount of blood loss and the degree of hemodynamic instability. Before the fall in systolic blood pressure heart rate rises to compensate for the blood loss  and thus the SI increases. The rule of 30 is an approximated blood loss of 30% of normal (70 ml/kg in adults 100 ml/kg throughout pregnancy) defined by a fall of 30% in hematocrit a fall of 30% in hemoglobin (approximately 3 g/dl) a fall of 30 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and a rise in pulse rate by 30 beats per minute.10 It has been shown that an SI ≥0.9 is associated with increased mortal - ity and an SI >1 increases the likelihood of blood transfusion.11 12 To date standard obstetric SI has been defined as 0.7– 0.9 compared with 0.5– 0.7 for the nonpregnant population taking into account that the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy may delay the recogni - tion of hypovolemia.5 If intravascular volume depletion is suspected  a rapid clinical assessment is required because the patient's clinical condition can deteriorate leading to the development of hemor - rhagic shock rapidly. Proper medical record- taking skills may high - light symptoms associated with shock such as pain and overt blood loss as well as general malaise anxiety and dyspnea. Notably in set - tings where few PPH treatment options exist and in cases of home deliveries diagnosis and treatment or referral must occur even ear - lier than in hospital settings to improve outcomes. For that reason  SI may be a valuable threshold in LMICs where mortality is highest and is often related to delays in complication recognition transpor - tation and level of care at the facility.2 A threshold of SI ≥0.9 should be tested to alert community healthcare providers of the need for urgent transfer.13 REFERENCES 1.

PPH guidelines usually address similar topics (e.g. di - agnosis prevention and treatment of PPH) but may differ in their recommendations.2– 4 These differences are because most of the recommendations are based on observational studies clinical judgment and expert opinion. There are few randomized con - trolled trials available to produce strong recommendations for the management of PPH due to the emergency of the condition that hinders this type of study. In the absence of randomized trials  guidelines gather the best available evidence. In addition popula - tion characteristics cultural aspects resources availability as well as frequency and timing of updates may influence the guidelines’ contents and justify some disparities.1– 4 REFERENCES 1.

Oxytocin has been cited as the drug of choice by most guidelines  but its dosages and route of administration vary largely especially when considering mode of delivery.1– 5 7– 10 In 2012 FIGO established recommendations for the prevention of PPH11 and in 2018 WHO updated its recommendation for pharmacological PPH prevention and reinforced the use of oxytocin (10 IU intramuscularly or intra - venously) as the drug of choice.12 WHO also recommends the use of carbetocin (if cost- effective) ergot alkaloids (alone or combined if there are no contraindications) or oral misoprostol in settings where oxytocin is not available or its quality cannot be guaranteed. Misoprostol is also recommended when the use of other injectable uterotonics is not possible due to unavailability or contraindication to use such as hypertension in the context of ergometrine.12 13 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) has updated its publication and reinforced the use of carbetocin as a first- line uterotonic for prevention at cesarean delivery or vaginal delivery with one risk factor.6 The German/Austrian/Swiss guideline mentions that prophylaxis during cesarean delivery can consist of administering either oxytocin or carbetocin.5 Other prophylactic strategies have been proposed in guidelines but many had no great consensus or no clear benefits.1– 7 Table 5 summarizes various PPH prevention strategies described by different societies worldwide.

Postpartum hemorrhage care bundles to improve adherence to guidelines: A WHO technical consultation. Int J Gynecol Obstet . 2020;148:290– 299. 6.2  |  Guidelines that address the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage PPH guidelines frequently recommend a multidisciplinary approach for reaching effective early control of bleeding. Treatment should be directed to the specific cause of PPH (uterine atony genital trauma  retained placenta and/or coagulopathy) and therapeutic steps should move from the less invasive method to the more complex and radical approach. A set of initial measures also seems to be consen - sual in most guidelines and consist of maintenance of two large IV lines supplementation of oxygen strict monitoring of women crys - talloids infusion and measures to avoid hypothermia and evaluate the PPH cause.1– 9 If atony is the etiology most guidelines suggest perform - ing temporary mechanical measures such as uterine massage or uterine bimanual compression with concurrent pharmaco - logical treatment.1– 10 Uterotonics are considered the first- line treatment for uterine atony. Intravenous oxytocin is usually the preferred drug and route of administration but its dosage varies widely. When oxytocin fails to control PPH guidelines recom - mend the use of an additional drug such as ergot alkaloids in - jectable prostaglandins or misoprostol.1– 4 6– 8 10 SOGC mentions carbetocin as a uterotonic available for treatment 5 and the German/Austrian/Swiss guidelines highlight that the use of car - betocin to treat PPH is currently not sufficiently investigated4 (Table 6). Since publication of the World Maternal Antifibrolytic (WOMAN) trial 11 tranexamic acid (TXA) an antifibrinolytic drug has been in - corporated into PPH guidelines around the world.4 6– 10 12 13 WHO has updated this topic and recommends the use of TXA as soon as possible within the first 3 h from birth at a dose of 1 g intravenously  regardless of the route of birth.12 13 However some guidelines do not cite it5 or do not add it in a definitive manner because their last update occurred before the WOMAN trial results.1 2 Another drug that has been discussed in many guidelines is recombinant activated factor VII for massive PPH; however there is no consensus about its use.1– 6 When pharmacological treatment fails in controlling hemor - rhage guidelines usually recommend some mechanical radiologi - cal and more conservative surgical approaches before performing hysterectomy. The available guidelines are summarized in Table 6. The most cited ones are uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) uterine compressive sutures (UCS) pelvic vascular ligation (PVL) and embo - lization.1– 7 10 Uterine packing with gauze is also mentioned in some guidelines but its use is controversial.3 5 ACOG mentions the use of a gauze soaked with thrombin.6 German/Austrian/Swiss guidelines cite the use of intrauter - ine packing with a gauze coated with a hemostatic agent.4 Due to the lack of evidence guidelines do not necessarily recommend these conservative approaches in a well- defined step- wise pro - gression and their utilization depends mainly on the availability of resources professional familiarity with technique and clinical circumstances.10 UBT is typically indicated as the treatment of choice when uter - ine atony is refractory to uterotonics after vaginal delivery as it is less invasive than the other procedures.1– 3 6– 9 This should be con - sidered after ruling out retained products of conception ruptured uterus or vaginal or cervical laceration as a contributing factor. If UBT fails to control bleeding in these cases invasive treatments by arterial embolization or most commonly by surgical approaches are recommended (Table 7). UCS and/or PVL are recommended to avoid hysterectomy when laparotomy is performed. The most mentioned UCS techniques in guidelines are B- Lynch Hayman and/or Cho su - tures while the most cited PVL techniques are bilateral uterine and/ or utero- ovarian vessel ligations and less frequently hypogastric ligature.1– 10 PVL and UCS can also be used together. Embolization is also cited as a conservative therapeutic strat - egy; however it is most often indicated in places where spe - cialized equipment and professionals are available in a timely manner.1– 5 7 10 Therefore these conditions may limit its use in acute bleedings. If bleeding is severe especially in low- resource settings some guidelines recommend the use of temporizing measures such as aortic compression and more recently the nonpneumatic antishock garment (NASG) to reduce blood loss until appropriate care is avail - able or while awaiting transfer to a higher- level facility.3 7 14 15 NASG has been recommended by WHO and FIGO for postpartum women with severe hemorrhage showing signs of shock or hemodynamic instability at all levels of care especially at the primary healthcare level or if transport to a higher facility is necessary.3 14 15 Regarding hysterectomy it is usually recommended when other procedures have failed to control massive bleeding or when they were not indicated. Guidelines highlight that hysterectomy should be performed “sooner rather than later ” before the patient devel - ops coagulopathy.1– 7 9 10 Recently damage control surgery (intra- abdominal or pelvic packing) has been mentioned in some PPH guidelines as an approach for critically ill patients with persistent bleeding after hysterectomy.4 7 Finally many guidelines also address statements for the manage - ment of genital tract trauma (especially uterine inversion and uterine rupture) coagulopathy disorders and retained placenta in obstetric patients. Because of the high maternal morbidity and mortality re - lated to the placenta accreta spectrum and its relation to the high rates of cesarean deliveries in many countries around the world  18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Since 1992 carbetocin has been extensively tested in the management of PPH.1 2 Beyond its uterotonic effects  carbetocin may also promote blood coagulation.3 7.1.1  |  Clinical evidence for PPH prevention: oxytocin versus carbetocin (vaginal delivery) The Heat- Stable Carbetocin versus Oxytocin to Prevent Hemorrhage after Vaginal Birth (CHAMPION) study provided new evidence comparing oxytocin and carbetocin.4 It studied 29 645 women with cervical dilation < 6 cm having a singleton pregnancy and planned for vaginal delivery. Patients were rand - omized to receive intramuscular injection of 100 µg heat- stable carbetocin (Paban) or 10 IU oxytocin in 10 different countries. The data showed that for PPH prevention heat- stable carbetocin was not inferior to oxytocin administration for blood loss of at least 500 ml (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.95– 1.06) or the use of additional uterotonic agents. Noninferiority was not shown for the outcome of blood loss of at least 1000 ml (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.87– 1.25). In this study when the two drugs were compared the following re - sults were obtained: in women with > 500 ml blood loss additional uterotonic agents were required in almost 15% of cases in both arms. When blood loss exceeded 1000 ml the requirement for additional uterotonics was only 1.5% in both arms.3 Therefore ac - cess to drugs is key since oxytocin has problems with drug purity in low- resource settings. The safety profile appeared to be similar for both drugs. More recently a network meta- analysis including 140 random - ized trials with data from 88 947 women was developed to identify the most effective uterotonic drug(s) to prevent PPH and generate a ranking according to their effectiveness and adverse effect pro - file.5 The data showed that compared with oxytocin the combina - tion of ergometrine plus oxytocin had a risk ratio of 0.69 (95% CI  0.57– 0.83) and was more effective; however with only moderate quality evidence and with higher risk of adverse effects such as vomiting and hypertension. For carbetocin the risk ratio was 0.72 (95% CI 0.52– 1.00) and although it was significant there was very low- quality evidence. Finally for misoprostol plus oxytocin the risk ratio was 0.73 (95% CI 0.60– 0.90) with moderate quality evidence and higher risk of fever.5 In a low- risk setting there may be advan - tages to using well- tested and readily available drugs. When the carbetocin effect was compared with the use of rectal misoprostol for preventing PPH in low- risk patient populations in a random - ized controlled trial among 150 pregnant women the data showed the superiority of carbetocin for efficacy.6 This was evidenced in all indices tested; beyond blood loss patients had a shorter third stage of labor and reduced need for additional uterotonic drugs. Additionally adverse effects such as diarrhea shivering and fever were more pronounced with misoprostol administration.6 In a ran - domized controlled trial of patients with severe pre- eclampsia car - betocin was shown to be a good alternative to oxytocin requiring a lower volume per dose.7 7.1.2  |  Clinical evidence for PPH prevention: oxytocin versus carbetocin (cesarean delivery) Cesarean delivery is a surgical procedure requiring high skill oper - ating time anesthesia intravenous fluids and different drugs. The addition of carbetocin therefore is expected to be of benefit and the need for a single drug administration reduces the need for an intensive management team which is generally required following a cesarean delivery. A Cochrane review including 11 studies showed that despite a statistically significant reduction in the need for fur - ther uterotonics in the carbetocin group compared with oxytocin in women undergoing a cesarean delivery no statistically significant differences in terms of the risk of PPH were noted.8 In 2018 a meta- analysis to analyze the effectiveness of carbetocin compared with oxytocin for the prevention of PPH in cesarean deliveries (seven studies involving 2012 patients) demonstrated a significant reduc - tion in the rates of PPH (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66– 0.94 P = 0.009) use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.49– 0.65 P < 0.001)  and transfusion (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.15– 0.64 P = 0.002) when carbe - tocin was used instead of oxytocin. However despite the potential benefits the disparity between the cost of carbetocin and oxytocin suggests that a locoregional cost- effectiveness analysis should be performed before making the decision to adopt carbetocin for rou - tine prophylaxis.9 In 2020 sequential trial analysis of five randomized controlled trials of studies with data on women (a total of 1214) undergoing nonelective cesarean deliveries where carbetocin was compared with oxytocin was performed.10 The need for additional uteroton - ics was reduced with carbetocin compared with oxytocin (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.11– 0.86; I2 90.60%). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) con - firmed that the information size needed to show a significant re - duction in the need for additional uterotonics had been exceeded. No significant differences were shown with respect to any of the secondary outcomes but there was significant heterogeneity be - tween the studies. The authors concluded that further trials utiliz - ing consistent core outcomes are needed to determine an effect on PPH.10 On the other hand a single center study was carried out to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of carbetocin compared with oxy - tocin when used for prophylaxis against PPH. With approximately 3000 cesarean deliveries per year the study showed that the use of carbetocin could prevent 108 episodes of PPH 104 episodes  18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Their cost- saving per PPH case was USD$ 278.70.11 Another study where 1500 cesarean deliveries (both elective and emer - gency) were analyzed over 12 months carbetocin use as opposed to oxytocin use reduced 30 (88 vs 58) PPH events ( >500 ml blood loss) and saved £27 518. Carbetocin had a 91.5% better outcome and was 69.4% cheaper.12 When compared with the need for ad - ditional uterotonics in the carbetocin group none required addi - tional medication versus 71.5% in the oxytocin group ( P < 0.01). In another prospective cohort study carbetocin used for 400 patients undergoing cesarean delivery led to reduced PPH and the use of other oxytocic agents saving £68.93 per patient.13 In 2019 a systematic review of the cost- effectiveness of uterotonic agents for the prevention of PPH was published with 15 studies across all income categories that compared misoprostol versus no uterotonic (five studies) or versus oxytocin (one study) carbeto - cin versus oxytocin (eight studies) and one study comparing nu - merous uterotonics.14 The evidence on the cost- effectiveness of various uterotonic agents was not generalizable to different con - texts. In the absence of reliable evidence the choice of uterotonic will likely be highly influenced by uterotonic price and contextual factors. In the context of cesarean delivery carbetocin was more cost favorable than oxytocin. The authors concluded the quality of the evidence provided by these studies has a lack of sensitivity analyzes and incomplete description of the methods of outcome and costs measurements in most studies. In addition some studies from middle- income countries favoring carbetocin were funded by the manufacturer. They interpreted findings from these studies and those of the conference abstracts with limited data cautiously  owing to the potential risk of bias and imprecision. Therefore it can be easily inferred that the relative cost- effectiveness of car - betocin is still inconclusive. Beyond its primary efficacy which is reduced blood loss a drug's safety profile must also be considered before wide- scale utilization. The adverse effects of carbetocin and oxytocin were examined in a small randomized study.15 The data showed that car - betocin had a lower rate of nausea. In contrast with other clinical indices including the need to stabilize systolic blood pressure and heart rate no other differences were noted.15 Since anesthesiolo - gists administer carbetocin for cesarean delivery the requirement for increased dose beyond the standard 100 ug in some instances was raised.16 The longer half- life of carbetocin prevents additional dosing in case of a persistent bleed and does not permit additional oxytocin administration. The increase in carbetocin dose from 100 µg to 140 µ g injection increases cardiovascular complications.17 Thus in cases of pre- eclampsia close attention is warranted for preserving patient safety before high dose carbetocin is adminis - tered. Also in those cases oxytocin doses must be increased to control bleeding beyond the standard treatment mainly if the drug was used during labor which may also increase complications rate. A case report showed that carbetocin administration for a patient with asthma led to nearly fatal bronchospasm and cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation which was successful.18 Therefore this drug should be used with caution in patients with asthma or those with advanced pulmonary pathology. This and other studies show inconsistency in adverse events data and indicate that the utility of carbetocin should be further assessed in additional pregnancy pathologies to establish the population in which the risk– benefit profile is favorable.

An antifibrinolytic drug is useful because hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion are common in the early stages of major postpartum bleeding and although existing medical and surgical interventions can be used to treat postpartum bleeding TXA offers an alternative way to sup - port hemostasis. 8.1  |  Administration of TXA 1. Administration of TXA is recommended as soon as the di - agnosis of PPH is made if the diagnosis is made within 3 h of delivery . When more than 3 h has elapsed since delivery  there is no clear evidence of benefit from TXA administration. TXA for PPH treatment is given 1 g IV over 10 min within 3 h of vaginal or cesarean delivery. One gram (10 ml of a 100 mg/ml solution) is infused over 10– 20 min because infu - sion >1 ml/min can cause hypotension. If bleeding continues after 30 min or stops and restarts within 24 h after the first dose a second dose of 1 g may be given. The antifibrinolytic effect lasts up to 7– 8 h in the serum. The concentration in breast milk is approximately one hundredth of the serum peak concentration so it is unlikely to have antifibrinolytic effects in the infant.2 3 The WOMAN trial found that administration of TXA within 3 h of delivery to women with established PPH decreases maternal mortality secondary to bleeding and reduces the need for laparotomy to control hemorrhage.2 2. TXA as a management strategy in addition to uterotonics re - duced the risk of PPH in randomized trials . Its use is effective in high- risk clinical settings (e.g. delivery of patients who refuse blood products patients with a significant risk for PPH such as placenta accreta or placenta previa or previous PPH). Usually  1 g TXA intravenously is recommended within 10 min after vag - inal delivery in addition to oxytocin cord traction and uterine massage.4 5 A Cochrane review of antifibrinolytic agents used for the treatment for PPH identified three eligible trials two of which compared intravenous TXA with placebo or standard care (the WOMAN trial and a French trial).4 6 A meta- analysis of 20 172 women from the WOMAN trial and the French trial (152 women with PPH received high- dose TXA a loading dose of 4 g over 1 h followed by an infusion of 1 g over 6 h) showed that TXA reduces the risk of death due to bleeding (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.65– 1.00) with early treatment being more effective. WHO updated its recommendation on the early use of TXA for the treatment of PPH (within 3 h of birth) with intravenous TXA using the same dosing regimen as in the WOMAN trial: a fixed dose of 1 g in 10 ml (100 mg/ml) intravenously at a rate of 1 ml/min. A second 1 g intravenous dose should be administered if bleeding continues after 30 min or restarts within 24 h of the first dose. 3. TXA should be given to all women with clinically estimated blood loss of more than 500 ml after vaginal birth or 1000 ml after ce - sarean delivery or any blood loss that is sufficient to compromise hemodynamic stability regardless of the cause of hemorrhage . TXA forms a reversible complex that displaces plasminogen from fibrin resulting in inhibition of fibrinolysis and inhibition of the proteolytic activity of plasmin. TXA is recommended for PPH management. It is given concomitantly with other drugs and pro - cedures for control of bleeding. An antifibrinolytic drug is useful because hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion are common in the early stages of major postpartum bleeding. Delay in treat - ment even if short reduces the benefit of TXA administration. The WOMAN trial found that TXA reduced death due to bleeding in women with PPH by 20%– 30% and was not associated with an increase in adverse effects. It also reduced the incidence of laparotomy to control bleeding by 36% but did not reduce hys - terectomy rates. However the decision to perform hysterectomy was sometimes made at the same time as randomization so some hysterectomies were performed before or concurrently with ad - ministration of TXA.2 3 8.2  |  TXA as a prophylactic measure Although the WOMAN trial presents evidence for the use of TXA to treat established PPH there is limited evidence for its role in prevention of PPH. Reviews and meta- analyses of multi - ple trials have shown that prophylactic use of TXA may decrease both postpartum bleeding and the need for blood transfusions.7 8 However larger adequately powered multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed before the prophylactic use of TXA can be recommended for the prevention of PPH. In 2021 a mul - ticenter double- blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 4551 women undergoing cesarean delivery before or during labor at 34 or more gestational weeks who received an intrave - nously administered prophylactic uterotonic agent and either TXA (1 g) or placebo. Among women who underwent cesarean delivery and received prophylactic uterotonic agents TXA treatment re- sulted in a significantly lower incidence of calculated estimated blood loss greater than 1000 ml or red- cell transfusion by day 2 compared with placebo but it did not result in a lower incidence of hemorrhage- related secondary clinical outcomes.9 Several sys - tematic reviews related to the treatment of PPH exist. Mousa et al.10 conducted a review that sought to include studies examin - ing the effectiveness of all types of treatments for PPH. However  their review primarily included studies involving treatment with misoprostol and little evidence regarding TXA. They concluded that more research was needed regarding the effectiveness of TXA for treatment of PPH.10 Additionally the existing systematic reviews that examined TXA for prophylaxis against PPH (where  18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Greater than 10%: headache (oral: 50%) abdominal pain (oral: 20%) back pain (oral: 21%) musculoskeletal pain (oral: 11%)  nasal signs and symptoms (oral: 25%; including sinus symptoms). 2. 1%– 10%: fatigue (oral: 5%) anemia (oral: 6%) arthralgia (oral: 7%)  muscle cramps (oral: ≤7%) muscle spasm (oral: ≤7%). 3. Less than 1%: allergic dermatitis allergic skin reaction anaphylac - tic shock anaphylactoid reaction anaphylaxis cerebral thrombo - sis chromatopsia conjunctivitis (ligneous) deep vein thrombosis  diarrhea dizziness hypersensitivity reaction hypotension (with rapid intravenous injection) nausea pulmonary embolism renal cortical necrosis retinal artery occlusion retinal vein occlusion  seizure ureteral obstruction visual disturbance vomiting. 8.4  |  Contraindications Hypersensitivity to TXA or any component of the formulation. 8.5  |  Implementation of treatment with TXA 1. TXA should always be readily available in obstetric care fa - cilities. It is cost- effective heat stable and widely available with a long shelf life. An economic evaluation that used data from the WOMAN trial to assess the cost- effectiveness of early TXA for usual care of women with PPH in Nigeria and Pakistan concluded that it is likely to be highly cost- effective.4 2. TXA should be used in addition to all usual treatments for the management of PPH including medical (uterotonics) nonsurgical  and surgical interventions.2 3 3. It has a wide therapeutic index and a further intravenous in - jection could be given when this becomes possible. Alternative routes of administration should be a research priority as recom - mended by WHO.12 4. Owing to improvements in emergency obstetric care including use of TXA as a first- line therapy more women will survive PPH than ever before. Furthermore the incidence of PPH is increas - ing 1 and consequently the number of women who will experience its physical and psychological consequences will also increase. More research is needed on how to reduce the risk factors for PPH. REFERENCES 1. Ker K Edwards P Perel P Shakur H Roberts I.

Direct abdominal and pelvic compression reduces the total vascular space in the lower body and decreases pelvic perfusion to pelvic compartment organs and smaller pelvic blood vessels promoting hemorrhage arrest.6 Additionally the pres - sure applied increases cardiac output and the central circulation al - lowing an increased distribution of blood flow to vital upper body organs (heart lung brains) and contributing to a rapid recovery from shock.1 7 Likewise the direct compression of the descending aorta re - duces bleeding from the uterine arteries and the mesenteric bed's vasculature perhaps decreasing up to 90% of blood flow at the level of the superior mesenteric artery.1 8 A further property of the NASG that makes it useful for maternal hemorrhage is the easy access to the vagina and perineum thereby facilitating genital medical and surgical interventions. Additionally  it is extremely cost- effective even for very low- resource settings  and is reusable as it can be disinfected and washed over 100 times without losing its compressive effects.3 It is also adjustable for many women of different girths and heights. 9.1.1  |  Safety According to human studies the NASG is a safe device with no ad - verse effects such as abdominal wall lesions or other types of po - tential injuries secondary to the circumferential pressure applied  independent of the patient's body mass index or the strength used to close each of the segments of the garment.2 In multiple studies  there were no adverse events associated with NASG use: no in - creased rates of dyspnea cardiac or renal dysfunctions. In fact in all studies of NASG involving extremely ill women with severe PPH  there were decreased rates of all severe maternal morbidities.4 Doppler studies of the distal aorta when the NASG is applied have shown a drop in the flow rate (volume/time) up to 33%. Additionally when the garment's abdominal and pelvic segments are placed the resistive index (inversely proportional to flow rate) of the internal iliac arteries increases.7 9.1.2  |  Effectiveness and advantages Multiple studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy and ef - fectiveness of the NASG. Observational quasi- experimental studies at referral centers in Egypt Nigeria India Zambia and Zimbabwe showed a 48% drop in maternal mortality related to hypovolemic shock (secondary to PPH).2 Overall the groups that received NASG treatment required fewer transfers to higher complexity facilities as well as abdominal hysterectomies (for definitive therapeutic ap - proach) than women in the control groups with a relative risk of 0.44 (95% CI 0.23– 0.86).9 A randomized controlled trial implemented in Zambia and Zimbabwe demonstrated that early placement of the NASG at pri - mary healthcare centers was associated with a statistically signifi - cant decline in shock recovery time (defined as shock index < 0.9)  with a median time to recovery of 170 min for the NASG group ver - sus 209 min for the control group with a hazard ratio of 1.2 (95% CI  1.02– 1.52 P = 0.03). Although the reduction in mortality and severe maternal morbidities (54%) in this study was not statistically signif - icant (perhaps due to much smaller sample size than was necessary to show statistical significance) it is still significant considering the seriousness of the outcomes.10 In 2015 a systematic review of quasi- experimental studies and the trial above compared PPH standard care versus standard care plus NASG. It found that the use of the NASG combined with stan - dard PPH care reduces both maternal mortality (48%) with a relative risk of 0.52 (95% CI 0.36– 0.77) and a 68% reduction in combined adverse outcomes mortality and severe morbidities (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17– 0.59). Furthermore safety was demonstrated by the ab - sence of differences in adverse events among groups.2 Effectiveness outside of clinical trials has been reported in one large implementation project in Tanzania that was conducted in 280 healthcare facilities in four rural regions with over 1700 women with PPH 24.5% ( n = 419) of whom had severe PPH and hypovolemic shock.11 Of these women 70.8% received the NASG which indicated high utilization and high acceptability. There was also a temporal as - sociation of a 67% reduced risk of mortality among women with se - vere PPH during the project (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.16– 0.60). Use of the NASG is recommended for the clinical stabilization and safe transfer to high complexity centers in the clinical scenario of PPH. This device is currently used in over 50 countries world - wide and it has been recommended in many national and interna - tional guidelines such as GLOWM WHO FIGO and others.12– 15 This device should be present in every healthcare facility as it has proven to be effective and safe granting significant reductions in PPH- related mortality.3 15 16 Besides the acceptability demonstrated in the Tanzania study qualitative research in a few settings has re - ported high acceptability from women and providers.11 17– 19 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

It is important to note that the gar - ment serves as a temporizing measure. Thus once hemodynamic stability is restored patients should receive definitive medical and surgical treatment. Table 8 provides a reference for the indications for NASG application.3 9.1.4  |  Instructions for use The NASG is composed of six articulated segments. The first three segments are bilateral and independent segments for the lower body parts: ankles calves and thighs. The other three circumferen - tial segments are placed over the pelvic and abdominal areas. It must first be unfolded entirely and placed under the patient's body. To assure proper application of the garment placement of the superior edge of segment 6 (the superior segment) over the lower rib should be confirmed. The device can be adjusted to all sizes and heights. For instance in shorter patients segment 1 can be folded into segment 2 to keep the first applied segment at the ankle and it can be per - formed whenever someone who is competent to insert it is available.For garment applications each segment must be stretched and closed as tightly as possible starting at the ankles with segment 1 and continuing with the remaining segments successively.5 It is im - portant to try to keep both knees uncovered by the leg segments to preserve joint mobility. The leg segments of the NASG can be placed by one or two people depending on the availability of healthcare personnel. Appliers can use the pubic symphysis as an anatomical reference point for placing segment 4. Appliers can use the umbili - cus as guidance for placing segments 5 and 6. Although all segments should be closed firmly and tightly the abdominal section must not be closed too tightly in order to maintain adequate respiration. For that reason it is advised that only one person should close segments 5 and 6. If there is more than one person available two people can coordinate their actions with one person presenting the opposite segment to the person who will close both segments together. If the patient shows signs of respiratory distress abdominal segments (5 and 6) can be loosened but not completely opened. If the patient requires surgical intervention the leg sections should remain closed while the pelvic and abdominal segments can be tem - porarily opened just before the skin incision is made and then closed once the procedure is concluded. In addition a drop in blood pres - sure should be expected when the abdominal and pelvic segments are opened and hence appropriate measures should be taken. 9.1.5  |  Monitoring and removal Patients using the NASG should be closely followed with continuous monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure and optimal fluid resus - citation.5 This device can be used safely for up to 48 h as a tempo - rizing measure until hemodynamic stability or adequate hemorrhage control is achieved. Nevertheless there are reports of the NASG used for longer than 72 h. To safely remove the NASG healthcare professionals must verify the following criteria: blood loss <50 ml/h  heart rate < 100 bpm and systolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg (rule of 100’s) for at least 2 h.5 Once the following criteria are corrobo - rated it is safe to start removing the garment. The intravenous line should remain in situ during the removal. Removal should follow the same steps as application starting with segment 1 at the ankles and moving slowly up to segment 6. Every time a segment is opened a 15- min period is allowed to re- evaluate vital signs and check for ac - tive bleeding. If vital signs remain stable and there are no signs of ac - tive bleeding it is safe to open the next segment. However if systolic blood pressure drops ≥20 mm Hg or heart rate increases ≥20 bpm (rule of 20’s) or active bleeding is identified all of the segments must be rapidly closed again. Once removed the NASG should be placed in a biohazard container and sent to be laundered dried and refolded. Videos and presentation slides of correct application use removal  and cleaning can be obtained for free at: www.safem other hood. ucsf.edu. These instructions must be followed strictly as incorrect removal of the garment could result in hemodynamic instability and recurrence of shock especially if the abdominal segment is the first segment to be opened.5 In the absence of hemodynamic instability TABLE 8  Indications for NASG applicationa FIGO recommendations on use of the nonpneumatic anti- shock garment for hypovolemic shock secondary to obstetric hemorrhage Population Any pregnant or postpartum woman with severe hemorrhage showing signs of shock/hemodynamic instability  at the primary healthcare level or if transport to higher facility is necessary: EBL 500 ml SBP < 100 mm Hg pulse >100 bpm; at high- level facilities: EBL >1000 ml SBP < 90 mm Hg pulse >110 bpm (or per facility protocols) Recommendation Rapidly apply NASG starting at the ankles.

Routine follow- up laboratories including hemoglobin and hematocrit are encouraged. Values over 7.5 mg/dl of hemoglobin and a hematocrit >23% are recommended; however there is neither consensus nor evidence about these values and further research is needed. 9.1.6  |  Adverse effects Currently no adverse effects have been documented with correct implementation of the NASG4; no increase in shock- related organ dysfunction adverse effects have been noted.9 9.1.7  |  Contraindications Currently there are no absolute medical contraindications for NASG use.3 Cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities such as heart failure  severe mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension are considered relative contraindications in nonobstetric patients.

If bleeding does not stop after its insertion then it is better to review the etiology of PPH. Placement of a UBT device should be considered early when emergency measures for man - agement of PPH are initiated. It should be performed by compe - tent healthcare providers who are trained in its insertion to avoid complications that can arise from misplacement. Perineal vaginal  and cervical tears and ruptured uterus must be excluded and the placenta carefully assessed for completeness to rule out retained fragments of the placenta. First- line emergency interventions for atonic PPH include uterine massage initiation of large intravenous BOX 7 FIGO recommends that all healthcare facilities have the NASG as an effective nonsurgical device that can be used as a temporary measure to recover hemodynamic stability for the management and transfer of a patient to a high level of care.  18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

If the uterus fails to contract ergometrine or misoprostol should be administered bi - manual uterine or aortic compression should be initiated a UBT placed and the NASG applied (response to refractory PPH bun - dle).2 These two sets of approaches have recently been defined as the “PPH bundle”.3 Observational studies have reported UBT success rates between 83% and 95% overall with nearly 100% survival among women with uncontrolled hemorrhage when a UBT device was placed before the onset of advanced shock.4– 6 The integration of UBT into PPH clinical pathways in high- income countries has been shown to avert hyster - ectomy and significantly reduce the need for PPH- related invasive procedures such as artery ligation uterine compression sutures and arterial embolization.7– 10 A 2020 systematic review and meta- analysis showed an overall pooled success rate of 85.9% (95% CI 83.9– 87.9%) for the treatment of PPH with higher pooled success rates corresponding to PPH due to uterine atony and placenta previa and lower pooled success rates for PPH due to placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) and retained prod - ucts of conception.11 A safety trial in Kenya and Sierra Leone on a uniquely designed condom uterine tamponade device (ESM- UBT) demonstrated no increased risk of infections or perineal injuries and success rates of condom UBT devices appear to be comparable to those of Bakri balloons.12 Available UBT devices and specific consid - erations are described below. 9.2.1  |  Available UBT devices Uterine balloon devices can be divided into two groups: 1. Fixed volume devices: condom uterine balloons (ESM- UBT kit  CG balloon) Bakri balloon Rusch balloon and Ebb system.12– 16 2. Free flow devices: the glove balloon Ellavi UBT and Zukovski balloon.17– 19 The glove and Ellavi balloons allow intrauterine pres - sure control according to systolic blood pressure. The Zukovski balloon uses 50 cm (3.8 cmHg) pressure for inflating the balloon. 9.2.2  |  Tamponade effect The mechanism of action of UBT devices is likely multifactorial. Two proposed mechanisms include device stimulation of receptors which in turn stimulates uterine contraction as well as the direct application of hydrostatic pressure against the bleeding sinuses. It has been proposed that if uterine wall pressure exerted by a UBT equals the systolic arte - rial pressure of the bleeding sinuses a tamponade effect is created.14 However Georgiou20 measured intraluminal pressures in Bakri bal - loons in two cases where UBTs had been placed and discovered that tamponade occurred at UBT device pressures lower than systolic blood pressures. Further research is needed to better understand the precise biomechanical relationship between a UBT device and a bleeding uterus.9.2.3  |  Free flow tamponade device Blood is supplied to the uterus via maternal arterial blood that passes through the myometrium through low resistance sinuses.21 Following delivery of the placenta the muscle fibers of the myome - trium contract and retract closing off the sinuses and limiting blood loss. While the immediate aim in PPH due to atonic uterus is to arrest blood loss the ultimate goal is to employ best practice interventions to facilitate contraction of the myometrium. The surgical glove bal - loon the Ellavi UBT and the Zukovsky balloon are free flow systems that allow water to be expelled from the balloon to theoretically better allow for the natural physiological process of contraction and retraction of the myometrium once the uterus has recovered.17– 19 However almost all commercially available UBT devices are low- pressure high- volume systems that allow for easy UBT expulsion when the uterus regains its tone and begins to contract. 9.2.4  |  Drainage port The need for a drainage port with a UBT device is questionable.13 14 16 Drainage ports are only a few millimeters in diameter and there - fore are easily obstructed by clotted blood. Furthermore since the source of bleeding in atonic uterus is from the site of placental im - plantation which encompasses only about 20% of the uterine cavity  a drainage port is less likely to be in proximity to the bleeding site. 9.2.5  |  Correct placement Multiple techniques have been described on the best approach to place a UBT device. The approach should in part be determined by the device being used (e.g. stiffness of the introducing end and num - ber of balloons). To ensure that the balloon could engage within the area that is actively bleeding all UBTs should be inserted through the cervix and positioned to sit in the upper uterine segment. One approach includes placing the hand into the uterus and ensuring that the fingertips reach the thick anterior and posterior layers of the upper segment. The UBT is then fed into the upper segment of the uterus with the free hand. When withdrawing the uterine hand the tubing is held with the free hand. While the balloon is filled two fin - gers are held in the vagina below the cervix to prevent inadvertent balloon expulsion. 9.2.6  |  Assessment of effect Multiple studies have shown that women with uncontrolled PPH from an atonic uterus will almost universally survive if a UBT device is placed in a timely fashion. If UBTs are placed before patients pro - gress to advanced shock success rates approach 100%.6 However  studies such as by Dumont et al.22 and Natarajan et al.23 have shown that improvised UBTs delays in recognition of PPH and lack of  18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License ###34###36 |    ESCOBAR Et Al. action on actual UBT placement may be barriers to improved out - comes. While different UBT systems may fill to their desired states at different rates it is even more important to recognize that impro - vised and untested UBTs are less often used. Moreover whenever they are their use is often delayed they are more difficult to place  fall out more easily and are associated with overall lower success rates.12– 14 17 19 Therefore immediate recognition of PPH and emer - gency action with a quality UBT device is imperative to save lives. 9.2.7  |  Transfer Many studies report high rates of hemorrhage control after UBT insertion thus rendering transfers unnecessary. Most often incor - rect diagnosis and misplacement are the cause of UBT failure. If bleeding recurs or the patient continues to be unstable after UBT insertion then consideration of transfer to higher levels of care should be made. Transfer can occur with both fixed- volume bal - loons and closed- off free- flow balloons but all UBTs must be care - fully secured to prevent accidental displacement. A transfer plan should be in place in all obstetric settings regardless of whether it will be needed or not. This is an absolute necessity in PPH bundles. 9.2.8  |  UBT after cesarean delivery Use of UBTs for hemorrhage control after cesarean delivery is a commonly performed technique worldwide but there is scant sup - porting literature. There are a few reports on successful outcomes with use of UBT in placenta previa. It appears that UBT has higher success rates in women with PPH after vaginal delivery than after cesarean delivery.11 18 24– 26 9.2.9  |  Combining UBT with compression sutures Placing a UBT after application of uterine compression sutures requires control of the amount of pressure exerted in the uterus to prevent uterine necrosis. Although uterine necrosis is possible following the insertion of compression sutures alone the risk un - derstandably would increase with pressure exerted from inside the uterus when UBT is used additionally. Cases with uterine necro - sis following insertion of compression sutures have been reported with and without UBT.27 28 The surgical glove balloon and the Ellavi UBT are UBT devices that allow the intrauterine pressure to be controlled by adjusting the height of the intravenous fluid bag or supply bag above the patient.17 18 With systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg and the supply bag or intravenous infusion fluid 1.3 m above the patient the pressure exerted by the balloon will be 100 mm Hg. The specific gravity of mercury is 13 times more than water. The device used for the balloon must be large enough to be inflated with fluid without requiring any expansion pressure. This is achieved by using a surgical glove and the Ellavi UBT.17 189.2.10  |  Other uses of UBT While the use of UBT for uncontrolled PPH is fairly well estab - lished published case reports and senior leaders in obstetrics and gynecology have described successful use of UBTs in other cir - cumstances such as in molar pregnancy- associated hemorrhage  placenta accreta retained placenta and in cases of intentional vaginal and cervical placement to temporize uncontrolled bleed - ing from lacerations.29 WHO recently published recommendations regarding use of UBT in the context of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth in women who do not respond to standard first- line treatment.30 According to WHO among the prerequisites for use of UBT evi - dence supports the need for access to surgical intervention and blood products as well as the availability of health personnel skilled in its use. They recognize that conditions may not be operationalized across all clinical settings and that observational studies suggest a substantial reduction in the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality following uterine balloon tamponade and that further research is needed in low- resource settings.

However unlike the medical and surgi - cal treatments for PPH no randomized controlled trials regarding its effectiveness have been conducted. The decision to perform uterine artery embolization in patients with persistent uterine bleeding should be made in consultation with an interventional radiologist. Although embolization may be considered as the technique of choice for manag - ing PPH by some authors certain practical issues must be considered.1 Uterine artery embolization has been shown to be effective in the treatment of various causes of PPH including placenta accreta:  Both UAE and uterine artery ligation have reported success rates of greater than 90% with low complication rates. If both techniques are available embolization is the preferred first choice as it obviates lap - arotomy. Ligation can be attempted subsequently if embolization is unsuccessful. In contrast after an unsuccessful uterine artery ligation  embolization may be extremely difficult or even impossible leaving hysterectomy as the only remaining option. Some cases may require hysterectomy because of failure of embolization. UAE has shown to be effective in controlling secondary bleeding and the placenta was found to gradually decrease in size in all patients. UAE plays an important role in managing these patients because it is effective at reducing uteropla - cental blood flow to further induce thrombosis of the intervillous space and to achieve necrosis of the retained placental tissue.2– 7 Selective UAE is effective in the control of PPH thus avoiding hysterectomy. Availability of resources to perform the procedure: A radiologist trained in embolization techniques is a prerequisite as is the appro - priate equipment for vascular intervention. Digital road- mapping may be required and the possible complexity means that this proce - dure can only be performed in a fully equipped X- ray department.8 The interventional radiologist inserts sheaths into both femoral ar - teries to deploy a deflated occlusion balloon into each of the internal iliac arteries.9 The sheaths are removed and the deflated balloons remain in place until after delivery. After the patient has undergone a cesarean delivery the interventional radiologist will inflate the balloons if needed based on the amount of bleeding. If inflating the  18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Ojala et al.13 and Badawy14 described a series of cases in patients who underwent embolization of the uterine arteries. Catheterization averted hysterectomy in close to 80% of cases. 9.3.1  |  Complications Some studies have documented resumption of menses and even pregnancies after the procedure.15 Complications of pelvic embo - lization for PPH occur at a rate of 8.7%. The most common com - plication is low- grade fever. Less common complications are pelvic infection groin hematoma iliac artery perforation transient buttock ischemia transient foot ischemia and bladder gangrene. Lee et al.16 listed dissection of the uterine arteries hematoma at the puncture site paresthesia and lower limb edema as complications. Currently most PPH cases requiring hysterectomy are related to placenta previa.17 . These patients are commonly diagnosed before delivery and are usually delivered by elective cesarean delivery. This planning may allow increased use of invasive radiological services in the management of such cases by inserting the intra- arterial bal - loons before going to surgery. 9.3.2  |  Implementation of treatment 1.

Upon laparotomy bleeding at the surgical site should be minimized by ad - equate packing to minimize time lost for suturing while active bleed - ing is ongoing. In all cases the uterus should be fully exteriorized if possible. Blood loss should be minimized while fully extending the uterus causing vasoconstriction and a tourniquet placed around the low segment until surgical compression sutures are successfully ap - plied.1 This enables the surgical team to use the following described methods by applying the uterine compression sutures with a high degree of safety. In addition injections of vasopressin at a dose of 4 U in 20 ml of saline in the placental bed after removal of the placenta may lead to reduced blood loss as well.2 Placement of en - douterine square hemostatic sutures may also be used to control bleeding from the placental bed.3 Hemostatic suturing technique as a second- line strategy for con - trol of uterine bleeding due to uterine atony is an effortless fast and conservative surgical procedure. It can be performed satisfactorily after a cesarean delivery or after a vaginal delivery.4 Complications related to its application have been identified but there are no re - ports of deaths related to compression sutures. Complications can include uterine synechia or ischemia uterine necrosis 5 intrauterine infection 6 and strangulation of the intestinal loop and abdominal omentum when nonabsorbable stitches are used 7 but nonabsorb - able sutures can be used if other types of sutures are not available. While most births are uncomplicated obstetricians are often faced with PPH at the time of vaginal or cesarean delivery.8 9 If ini - tial management with fundal massage manual uterine compression  or uterotonics (oxytocin misoprostol methergine or carboprost tromethamine) does not adequately reduce bleeding placement of compression sutures can be done to slow bleeding and stabilize the patient avoid hysterectomy and ultimately reduce maternal mor - bidity or death. The three most used compression suture techniques for PPH are B- Lynch 10 Hayman 11 and Pereira.12 Other compression sutures are cited in the literature such as Cho Ouahba Hackethal  and Massuba.8 If a Bakri balloon is available the obstetrician can combine any of these three compression sutures with the placement of the balloon to tamponade bleeding. In some instances expedient placement of an O’Leary stitch for temporary devascularization of the uterine arteries can decrease bleeding and allow additional time for placement of the compression sutures. As with the conduct of cesarean delivery specific practical issues have to be considered. First the obstetrician should be well versed in sterile pelvic vascular operative techniques as placement of sutures will occur at the time of cesarean delivery or with laparotomy following vaginal delivery and PPH. Second since time is critical to reducing maternal blood loss an operative team with the technical skills for additional an - esthesia administration of blood products and surgical assistance is crucial to the success of surgical management. Three commonly used compression sutures are described below and existing data are summarized on the effectiveness of each compression technique. 10.1.1  |  Commonly used compression sutures for managing PPH The B- Lynch suture was first introduced in 1997 by Christopher Lynch to address hemorrhage with open hysterotomy at the time of cesarean delivery.10 A suture is placed on the right side of the hysterotomy entering at the base of the incision and exiting at the top.13 The suture is then carried across the top of the right fundus and a posterior stitch is placed with the entrance of the suture at the same level of the anterior suture and exiting on the left posterior side of the uterus at the level of the uterine incision. Suture is then looped over the left fundus and another stitch is placed at the top of the left side of the uterine incision and exiting at the base of the incision. The suture is then tugged tightly compressing the body of the uterus with placement of a surgeon's knot. Following placement of the B- Lynch suture the transverse hysterotomy is closed in the usual fashion. In the original description of B- Lynch a chromic su - ture was used. Subsequent case studies have reported successful use of a monocryl suture. Additional options for compression sutures include the Hayman and Pereira. In 2002 the Hayman suture was designed to be a technically easier alternative to the B- Lynch suture that could be placed expediently and not require hysterotomy. The steps for placing a Hayman suture include two to four longitudinal (on the left and right side of the uterus) sutures that pass directly from the anterior uterine wall and through the posterior uterine wall and are tied using a surgeon's knot at the fundus. A transverse cervicoisthmic suture traversing the anterior and posterior uterine walls can be placed to address bleeding from the lower uterine segment. The Pereira compression technique includes five sutures com - bining two longitudinal sutures with three transverse sutures. The advantage of the Pereira sutures is that placement occurs in the submucosal region and avoids the endometrial cavity. However at - tention is needed for correct placement of the transverse sutures to prevent damage to the uterine vessels and ureters. Based on the available literature the success rate of compres - sion sutures in achieving hemostasis is 76%– 100%.14 To date no randomized controlled trials or controlled studies have compared the efficacy of the different compression sutures. In the three orig - inal studies for B- Lynch Hayman and Pereira success rates were reported as 100% (5/5 for B- Lynch 3/3 for Hayman and 7/7 for Pereira). In a systematic review 14 the overall success rate of com - pression sutures was reported as 91.7%. Given the broad use of compression sutures and the impact on maternal morbidity and mortality it is unlikely that a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of different compression techniques will be conducted. However an observational study comparing the effectiveness of  18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Internal iliac artery liga - tion may avoid the need for hysterectomy in the context of uterine atony.2 In addition in cases of traumatic PPH such as uterine rupture and extensive genital injuries internal artery ligation clears the op - erative field and facilitates hysterectomy.2 During the procedure the common iliac artery is identified. After dissection the ureter is visualized crossing the common iliac artery at its bifurcation. The common iliac artery branches into an internal iliac (hypogastric) artery coursing medially and inferiorly  and the external iliac artery coursing laterally and superiorly. The arteries are not infrequently adherent to the underlying veins and require appropriate dissection.5 With right- angled forceps a su - ture is introduced between the artery and the vein and a knot is made.4 5 Noteworthy is that even after bilateral internal iliac artery li - gation the vascular supply to the pelvis is not completely compro - mised due to the extensive collateral circulation that exists.4 5 The revascularization is provided by the deep femoral artery the anas - tomosis between the medial femoral circumflex and obturator ar - tery and that between the lateral femoral circumflex and superior gluteal artery and the ovarian artery.4 5 Obstetricians ought to be more familiar with this procedure as it is an effective and rapid way to control PPH.REFERENCES 1.

In most of the studies this was attributed to the increased rates of cesarean delivery.1– 5 The most common indications for peripartum hysterectomy are placental pathology such as abnormal placentation placenta previa  and placental abruption (38%) uterine atony (27%) and uterine rup - ture (26%).2 Peripartum hysterectomy is associated with high rates of maternal morbidity and complications due to the need for blood transfusions coagulation disorders injury to the urinary tract the need for re- exploration in case of persistent bleeding and postop - erative fever.1 The maternal mortality rate varies according to countries rang - ing from 0% in Turkey 6 the UK 7 and New Zealand 8 to 3.2% in Australia 9 and as high as 11.8% in Nigeria.10 REFERENCES 1.

This is achieved by a staged surgical approach that minimizes operative time  counteracting life- threatening conditions and deferring the de- finitive surgical procedures until normal physiology is restored at the intensive care unit (ICU).5– 7 Efforts in DCR are focused on permissive resuscitation by blood product transfusion use of massive blood transfusion protocols limited use of crystalloids bleeding control (including damage control surgery [DCS] and damage control interventional radiology [DCIR]) and physiological and biochemical stabilization in the ICU.4– 6 DCR is usually reserved for severely injured patients who may not survive the surgical efforts to achieve primary re - pair in the operating room.4 It is evident that this approach can be considered only in higher- level care facilities where there is avail - ability of experienced personnel with 24- h laboratory and blood bank services. The most important aspects of DCS are described below. Hypotensive and hemostatic reanimation are discussed in sections 11.2.1 and 11.2.6 respectively. 11.1.1  |  Decision for damage control surgery Physiological and metabolic markers have been proposed to identify patients that could benefit from DCS.4 Three parameters have been described in the literature as significant clinical indica - tors for early implementation of DCR and DCS8: acidosis (base deficit >8) blood loss > 1500 ml and hypothermia (temperature <35°C). Other important parameters to consider are systolic blood pressure < 70 mm Hg maternal blood pH < 7.1 and persis - tent bleeding despite several transfusions (defined as 6 units of packed red blood cells by some authors7 and > 10 units by oth - ers4) (Table 9). Continuous vital sign monitoring and serial monitoring with blood gas analysis and body temperature are recommended. Operative time and number of blood units transfused are also crucial for DCR decision- making.411.1.2  |  Bleeding control After identifying eligible DCS patients when medical and surgical conservative measures to control bleeding fail a sequential four- phase approach should be performed.4 Initial laparotomy The primary objective is hemorrhage control which is achieved by an abdominal hysterectomy. The type of hysterectomy to be performed depends on the preference and expertise of the operator and the clinical condition of the patient; other factors such as age cause of hemorrhage hemodynamic stability and pelvic anatomy must be considered.9 According to several stud - ies there are no statistically significant differences between total and subtotal hysterectomy in terms of complications blood transfusions and ICU admission.9– 11 Subtotal hysterectomy has been associated with quicker hemorrhage control and shorter operative times hence is the preferred approach over total hysterectomy.9 11 The bleeding site must be identified to pick the most suitable approach. When the bleeding is in the lower uterine segment  cervix or vaginal fornices a subtotal hysterectomy may not be the most effective approach for hemorrhage control since the ar - terial circulation of the cervix has a high blood flow rate and could cause bleeding persistence. In these cases total hysterectomy is preferred.9 10 Operative time is a crucial determinant in patient survival. Prolonged operative time has been linked to adverse outcomes as it can institute an irreversible physiologic insult; thus the need to keep operative time under 90 min.4TABLE 9  Alternative indications for damage control surgery secondary to postpartum hemorrhagea Indication Systolic blood pressure < 70 mm Hg Body temperature < 34ºC Maternal blood pH < 7.1 Venous bleeding not suitable for surgical control Persistent bleeding despite several transfusions of blood products (>10 units of PRBC) Massive transfusion: 6 units of Red Blood Cells (during the first 4 h) Increasing and continuous need for fluids due to active nonarterial bleeding Hemodynamic instability requiring persistent vasopressor support or that results in the development of ventricular arrhythmias Coagulopathy resulting from a combination of hypothermia (temperature < 35°C) acidosis (pH < 7.3) and loss of coagulation factors Duration of surgery > 90 min aSource: Carvajal et al.

As in other surgical specialties packing is the cornerstone of obstetric DCS.4 7 Pelvic packing should be performed with at least 7– 10 compresses according to reported experience.2 12 Aside from pelvic packing temporary abdominal closure is performed along - side as a complementary feature of the procedure. The latter can be achieved using a negative pressure system like vacuum pack or partial closure with a Viaflex bag (Bogota Bag) without the need for negative pressure.2 12 Currently there is neither consensus nor sufficient evidence regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing DCS with abdominal packing.4 Several surgi - cal guidelines recommend the administration of a single preopera - tive dose of broad- spectrum antibiotics which theoretically should provide sufficient coverage for aerobic and anaerobic microorgan - isms.4 13 14 Other experts suggest administration of prophylactic broad- spectrum antibiotics every 6– 8 h until the abdominal packing is removed. Nevertheless further studies are necessary to provide evidence- based recommendations in the obstetric population.7 Resuscitation –  ICU At this stage the patient must be transferred to the ICU to address the physiologic derangements of the hemorrhagic patient: coagula - tion disorders and metabolic abnormalities.6 Interdisciplinary care involving the obstetrician and critical care specialist is key for these patients as complications could arise at any time.4 It is crucial to ac - curately quantify the accumulation of blood in the abdominal cavity. The optimal device to do so after partial abdominal closure is the vacuum pack which allows a more precise quantification of bleeding during the postoperative period. In patients without coagulopathy  the drainage of > 400 ml/h of blood through the vacuum pack repre - sents an early indication for laparotomy.4 Definitive surgery After restoring normal physiology it is considered safe to review the abdominal cavity. Ideally this should be performed 48– 72 h after the initial surgical procedure.4 Patients may require one or more surgical interventions depending on the operative findings. In cases where further interventions are warranted it is recommended to continue with techniques of temporary closure of the abdominal cavity.15 Definitive closure of abdominal wall and cavity The final stage is the definitive closure of the abdominal wall which is performed after all surgeries have been successfully completed and all additional damage has been repaired.4 11.1.3  |  Complications The majority of DCS complications depend on the time of closure of the abdominal fascia. It is important to consider that the number of reinterventions is directly related to a higher percentage of infec - tious complications wound dehiscence and abdominal wall closure problems.16 The main complications include infection of the surgical wound in 28% of cases presence of intra- abdominal collections in 20% and evisceration in 10% of patients.2 Implementation of pro - phylactic antibiotic therapy could counteract these complications as it targets the polybacterial flora present in the female genital tract. An interdisciplinary approach could be required in case of complica - tions derived from injuries secondary to the surgical procedure such as urinomas perforations or fistulas among others.17 11.1.4  |  Final objectives in resuscitation DCR should be maintained as long as there are signs of bleeding and coagulopathy. A continuous assessment of the hemodynamic and physiological status of the patient is required. Monitoring several resuscitation parameters is essential until tissue hypoxia reverts. These parameters include pH base deficit lactate hematocrit and coagulation— ideally evaluated with conventional laboratory tests and point- of- care testing (POCT) of viscoelastic coagulation such as thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). In patients with a clinical trend toward improvement the decision to perform definitive surgery is appropriate.4 REFERENCES 1. Pacheco LD Saade GR Gei AF Hankins GD.

There are two strategies for fluid resuscitation in patients with hemorrhage: the aggressive approach and the hypotensive resusci - tation approach. Aggressive resuscitation refers to the traditionally used strategy in which the key principle is restoring the effective circulating blood volume and rapid normalizing of blood pressure with administration of large amounts of crystalloids.2 4 Hypotensive resuscitation also called permissive hypotension consists of restric - tive crystalloid resuscitation during the early stages of a hemorrhagic shock to maintain lower than normal systolic or mean blood pressure  sustaining organ perfusion until control of the bleeding occurs.2 5 In contrast hemostatic reanimation is based on early and ag - gressive blood product replacement transfusing red blood cells (PRBC) fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets (PLT) in the same proportion as found in circulating blood to correct coagulopathy.6– 8 Hypotensive resuscitation and hemostatic reanimation are the fun - damentals for DCR.9 10 11.2.1  |  Hypotensive resuscitation The concept of hypotensive resuscitation is because administering small crystalloid volumes reduces the risk of dilutional coagulopathy and maintaining a lower blood pressure is less likely to disintegrate the pre- formed blood clots. Aggressive resuscitation may worsen coagu - lopathy and hemorrhage by increasing intravascular hydrostatic pres - sures diluting coagulation factors and inducing more hypothermia  which results in deterioration of the triad of death.4 10 11 Furthermore  an excessive rise in blood pressure could also result in higher red blood cell loss leading to more hypoxia and acidosis in tissues.4 11 11.2.2  |  Intravenous fluids Among the initial strategies for reanimation the administration of crystalloids in small boluses of 500 ml is recommended.10 Scientific evidence recommends the use of balanced crystalloid solutions such as Ringer's lactate owing to the risk of hyperchloremic acidosis and the worsening of kidney function with chlorine- rich fluids (saline so- lution).7 This is particularly important for LMICs where saline- based solutions are in abundance. After the administration of each bolus  physicians must assess the clinical status of patients looking for an im - provement in signs and symptoms of shock resulting from blood loss.10 11.2.3  |  Targeted blood pressure The difference between aggressive and hypotensive resuscitation lies within targeted blood pressure management.4 Mean arterial pressure (MAP) represents the perfusion of the majority of organs  therefore providing the target for clinicians to guide fluid adminis - tration.11 Hemorrhagic shock animal models have demonstrated a positive benefit in survival with MAP between 55– 60 mm Hg dur - ing active bleeding.10 The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma recommends permissive hypotension with a systolic blood pressure target of 80– 90 mm Hg (MAP 50– 60 mm Hg) until major bleeding has been con - trolled (Recommendation Grade 1C).12 11.2.4  |  Aggressive approach and adverse outcomes During hemorrhagic shock the endothelial glycocalyx becomes thin - ner and administration of large amounts of crystalloids exacerbates this state leading to fluid extravasation that may cause cerebral  cardiac and pulmonary edema.7 10 11 Third spacing may also lead to cardiac dysfunction worsen hemodynamics and decrease kidney perfusion. Decreased kidney perfusion occurs because of an in - crease in intra- abdominal pressure which can additionally result in abdominal compartment syndrome.7 11 11.2.5  |  Evidence Several studies in trauma patients have demonstrated that hy - potensive resuscitation is correlated with benefits to survival  18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

The use of FFP PLT and cryo - precipitate was delayed until coagulopathy was demonstrated in paraclinics.7 Hemostatic resuscitation limits the use of crystal - loids and involves early administration of blood products (not only PRBC) making massive transfusion protocols the cornerstone of resuscitation.7 10 11.2.7  |  Transfusion ratios In hemostatic resuscitation PRBC FFP and PLT are applied in a 1:1:1 ratio due to the resemblance with whole blood and because a “high ratio” is related to fewer complications and better patient survival outcomes.6 7 10 15 If PRBC is not available then whole blood can be used instead in case of massive hemorrhage. The strongest evidence for massive transfusions comes from the Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMTT) and Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) trials. The PROMTT study evidenced an improve - ment in mortality in the first 6 h for patients with high ratios of trans - fusion ( <1:2 vs ≥1:1).16 Moreover a secondary analysis from PROMTT revealed that early administration of plasma (first 3 h and within the first 3– 6 transfused units) was related to a decrease in mortality at 24 h and 30 days.17 However the PROPPR study demonstrated that patients transfused with a 1:1:1 ratio achieved hemostasis and suf - fered fewer deaths due to exsanguination at 24 h.18 11.2.8  |  Fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate In hemorrhages fibrinogen is the first clotting factor to diminish its concentrations to critical levels with values of < 200 mg/dl consid - ered an indication for component replacement.7 10 Achieving specific fibrinogen levels is an important target during massive transfusion (at least 150– 200 mg/dl in PPH).7Sources for fibrinogen replacement are FFP cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrates (which are not widely available). Because fi - brinogen concentration in FFP is variable and relatively low and its administration may dilute the existent fibrinogen most fibrinogen replacement is done with cryoprecipitate.12 A unit of cryoprecipitate contains 2 g fibrinogen for each 100 ml; thus a unit of cryoprecipi - tate will increase serum fibrinogen by 10 mg/dl.7 The usual dose of cryoprecipitate is 10 units which is estimated to raise serum fibrino- gen by 100 mg/dl.7 Subsequent doses must be adjusted conforming to serum fibrinogen levels. 11.2.9  |  Massive transfusion protocols As the underlying physiological imbalance and clinical course in trauma seem similar to severe PPH massive transfusion pro - tocols with high ratios utilized for trauma may be useful for PPH.19 20 Recommendations for ratios 1:1– 1:2 for transfusions are different from previously proposed protocols with ratios of 6:4:1 or 4:4:1 as in the CMQCC Obstetric Hemorrhage Toolkit and from other obstetrics societies.21 ACOG recommends admin - istration of blood products in 1:1:1 ratio mimicking whole blood replacement.22 Massive transfusion means requirements of ≥4 PRBC units (some articles considered ≥10 PRBC within 24 h) replacement of total blood volume within 24 h or replacement of 50% of blood volume within 3 h.10 The protocol for massive transfusion is spe - cific at each institution but some schemes have been suggested in the literature. Once the massive transfusion protocol has been activated the blood bank will send blood products in rounds to the operating or labor room. Each round has a specific number of PRBC FFP PLT  and cryoprecipitate units according to the protocol established in the institution. Typical rounds consist of 6 units PRBC 6 units FFP 6 units PLT or 1 platelet apheresis and 10 units of cryoprecipitate (Table 10).7 23 24 Unless inactivated the blood bank will prepare and send the prod - ucts for rounds 2– 4 successively and if the patient continues bleed - ing the protocol will start again from round 1.7 It is very important to notify the blood bank as soon as the transfusion requirements decrease to stop the preparation of blood products.7TABLE 10  Massive transfusion protocol in obstetricsa PRBCs FFP Platelets Cryoprecipitate Round 1 6 U 6 U 6 U 10 U Round 2 6 U 6 U 6 U 10 U Round 3 Tranexamic acid 1 g intravenously over 10 min Round 4 6 U 6 U 6 U aSource: Pacheco et al.

Care bundles have been associated with improved patient outcomes when adherence is high. The goal of the PPH bun - dle is to reduce the frequency of severe hemorrhage and improve maternal outcomes. There is still a need for good-  quality research to determine whether the bundle approach will ultimately make a difference in saving women's lives from PPH. 2. In recent years new scientific evidence and the availability of new technologies have driven important reflections about PPH. To guarantee quality of guidelines it is important to update the evidence and base recommendations on the best quality stud - ies available. It is also essential to stimulate production of new research on the key themes of PPH to reduce disparities among guidelines. PPH guidelines have helped improve the care of women around the world and their use should be stimulated in all scenarios. 3. The shock index indicator defined as the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure is simple to use. It has better predictive ability than other vital signs because it detects acute changes in the maternal cardiovascular system and appears as an early marker to predict adverse outcomes. 4. Evidence continues to support oxytocin as the first- line drug in the prevention of PPH in all births. 5. Women with PPH should receive a fixed dose of 1 g tranexamic acid in 10 ml (100 mg/ml) intravenously (1 ml/min) as soon as possible after delivery and no more than 3 h after birth. A sec - ond dose of 1 g should be given intravenously if bleeding con - tinues after 30 min or restarts within 24 h of the first dose. Tranexamic acid should be given in addition to usual treatments for the management of PPH including medical (uterotonics)  nonsurgical and surgical interventions regardless of the cause of hemorrhage or the mode of delivery. 6. The nonpneumatic antishock garment (NASG) is an effective nonsurgical device that should be in every healthcare facility. The NASG when used as a temporizing measure to recover hemodynamic stability in the context of PPH decreases mor - bidity mortality and hypovolemic shock and is of special impor - tance in LMICs. While considerable research is still necessary to improve knowledge on implementation issues professional as - sociations and national and international guidelines should con - tinue to encourage NASG use for refractory PPH management. 7. Uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) is an effective nonsurgical technique that when employed rapidly by a properly trained person with a proven device in the context of quality PPH care (the PPH bundle) improves survival of women with refractory PPH. National and international guidelines should include UBT use in the management of PPH. 8. Interventional radiology may be indicated for the prevention and treatment of PPH either before delivery in cases of known placental abnormalities and implantation or after delivery when the patient is hemorrhaging. Prophylactic catheterization of the uterine arteries with embolization can be considered an impor - tant therapeutic strategy that is safe and effective for reducing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality by controlling blood loss. 9. Regardless of the compression suture chosen obstetricians must first quickly recognize the onset of PPH safely admin - ister uterotonics and place emergent compression sutures if needed. In the immediate postoperative period women should be monitored for complications such as hematometra  pyometra and uterine synechiae. Most important is the ability of the obstetrician to control bleeding using medical and sur - gical interventions stabilize the mother and reduce maternal morbidity. 10. PPH is a serious life- threatening obstetric emergency and early recognition of this condition results in better outcomes. In cases where medical treatment fails to control the bleeding several surgical options exist. To date no randomized controlled trials have assessed these techniques nor compared the superiority of one to another and all the data are based on case reports and case series. Moreover the use of these methods largely depends on the facilities provided in each institution and on the care pro - viders’ skills and familiarity with the procedures. Hence an ef - fort should be exercised for better training of all care providers in these life- saving techniques. Future fertility rate following these procedures remains underassessed due to the lack of long- term follow- up for these cases. In the future more research should target these surgical techniques to shy away from the more morbid procedures thereby improving maternal and perinatal outcomes. 11. Damage control resuscitation (DCS) is a combination of resuscita - tion and surgical interventions with the purpose of restoring he - mostasis and normal physiology. These techniques have proven to be applicable in obstetrics with satisfactory results controlling re- fractory PPH and an overall decreased mortality of critically ill pa - tients especially in patients in whom conventional treatment can be linked to a high risk of failure. DCS is an available therapeutic approach for the management of severe PPH thus proper training must be widespread to implement this technique. 12. Basic recommendations for resuscitation in PPH include admin - istration of crystalloids in small boluses of 500 ml checking clini - cal signs and looking for its improvement and use of balanced crystalloid solutions such as Ringer's lactate which is preferred over chlorine- rich solutions. The target blood pressure in hypo- tensive resuscitation is 80– 90 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure or 50– 60 mm Hg for mean blood pressure. 13. In hemostatic reanimation fewer crystalloids are administered and instead transfusional replacement is started earlier with high ratios of transfusion (1:1:1). During massive transfusions  the target for serum fibrinogen is 150– 200 mg/dl and the usual dose of cryoprecipitate is 10 units; it is estimated that these will raise the serum fibrinogen by 100 mg/dl. The protocol for mas - sive transfusion is specific at each institution. Physicians should be familiar with their hospitals’ protocol and recommendations. 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Anyone who attends a birth can be taught simple home- based life-  saving skills. The evidence- based prevention and management of PPH can be achieved with the use of relatively inexpensive drugs. Women should be monitored closely during the first hour after de - livery of the baby and placenta and accurate blood loss measure - ment should be implemented. Barriers and gaps can be addressed through providing an enabling environment through supportive policies designing a formal plan for supplies task shifting strategies  and use of guidelines and protocols for successful implementation. 15. Simulation training on how to manage PPH is encouraged and each hospital should have a protocol on the management of PPH. OBGYN societies should lobby to have the essential medi - cations that are needed to prevent and treat PPH readily avail - able in all maternity centers. 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Justificación y definición 1.1 Justificación Es un hecho reconocido a nivel mundial que la oportunidad y la calidad de la atención en el manejo de la hemorragia obstétrica son fundamentales para disminuir las com- plicaciones y la mortalidad. Las principales razones para la alta mortalidad asociada a hemorragia son: la demora en el reconocimiento de la hipovolemia falla en el reem-plazo adecuado del volumen y demora en la intervención quirúrgica (1). La mortalidad materna es de 400 por 100.000 nacidos vivos lo que significa 529.000 muertes por año. De estas muertes aproximadamente 150.000 son debidas a hemorra-gias obstétricas la mayoría por hemorragia posparto (HPP) que en muchos países es la primera o segunda causa de mortalidad materna (1-3). En Bogotá D. C. en 2012-2013 esta pérdida de sangre fue la primera causa de mortali- dad materna: 12 casos (29%) en el 2012 7 casos (29%) en el 2013 (2). El “código rojo” consiste en crear un esquema de trabajo organizado de tal manera que cuando se presente una hemorragia obstétrica le permita al equipo asistencial seguir los pasos indicados sin desviarse del objetivo trabajar de manera ordenada y coordi-nada y que pueda ser replicado en cada situación específica logrando así disminuir la morbimortalidad generada por esta causa (nivel de evidencia 3 grado de recomendación C) (1 4). 1.2 Niveles de evidencia y grados de recomendación (clasificación de Oxford) (5) Niveles de evidencia 1++Metaanálisis de alta calidad revisiones sistemáticas de ensayos clínicos o ensayos clínicos de alta calidad con muy poco riesgo de sesgo. 1+Metaanálisis bien realizados revisiones sistemáticas de ensayos clínicos o ensayos clínicos bien realizados con poco riesgo de sesgos. 1- Metaanálisis revisiones sistemáticas de ensayos clínicos o ensayos clínicos con alto riesgo de sesgos. 2++Revisiones sistemáticas de alta calidad de estudios de cohortes o de casos y controles.

Se calcula que la cantidad de sangre perdida puede ser subestimada hasta en un 50% por lo que se recomienda clasificar el choque de acuerdo con el peor parámetro encontrado (no se recomienda hacerlo solo de acuerdo con la percepción subjetiva de la pérdida sanguínea) (nivel de evidencia 2 grado de recomendación B) (7). Los signos síntomas (sensorio perfusión pulso y presión arterial) y su relación con el grado de pérdida sanguínea y choque hipovolémico deben estar listados y expuestos (tabla de clasificación de choque y/o índice de choque) en el sitio de atención de par - tos cesárea y recuperación posparto con el fin de orientar las estrategias de manejo (tabla 3).

Quantitative blood loss measurement should replace estimated blood loss for all deliveries. 2. Maximum single dose oxytocin doses should be 3 IU IV rapid injection or 10 IU intramuscular 3. In cases of severe obstetrical hemorrhage the calculated maximum allowable blood loss and lab-based (or point-of-careebased) factor replacement should guide treatment whenever possible. 4. Misoprostol should only be used sublingually or orally for the prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. KEY MESSAGES 1. Reducing the risk of postpartum hemorrhage begins antenatally and continued vigilance is needed throughout labour to recognize abnormal postpartum bleeding early. 2. Appropriate recognition and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage can prevent serious morbidity while reducing costs to the health care system by minimizing costly interventions and length of hospital stays. 3. Simulation training followed by formal debrie ﬁng will improve outcomes in the clinical setting. ABSTRACT Objective: This guideline aims to provide evidence for prevention recognition and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage includingsevere hemorrhage leading to hemorrhagic shock. Target population: All pregnant patients. Bene ﬁts harms and costs: Appropriate recognition and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage can prevent serious morbidity whilereducing costs to the health care system by minimizing more costlyinterventions and length of hospital stays. Evidence: Medical literature PubMed ClinicalTrials.gov  the Cochrane Database and grey literature were searched for articles published between 2012 and 2021 on postpartum hemorrhage uterotonics obstetrical hemorrhage and massive hemorrhage protocols. Validation methods: The authors rated the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. See online Appendix A (Tables A1 for deﬁnitions and A2for interpretations of strong and conditional [weak] recommendations). Intended Audience: All members of the health care team who care for labouring or postpartum women including but not restricted to nurses midwives family physicians obstetricians andanesthesiologists. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. An individualized risk assessment for postpartum hemorrhage should be documented in a checklist upon arrival to a labour unitand updated throughout labour and delivery ( strong high ). The riskassessment should include a calculation of the maximum allow- able blood loss ( good practice point ). 2. Both antenatal and postnatal anemia should be identi ﬁed and treated aggressively ( strong high ). 3. Quantitative blood loss measurement should replace estimated blood loss in all patients whenever possible ( strong moderate ). 4. Staging and management of postpartum hemorrhage should be based on quantitative blood loss ( strong high ). 5. Active management of the third stage of labour should be offered to all women ( strong high ). 6. Prophylactic intramuscular oxytocin can be used for patients at low risk for postpartum hemorrhage ( strong high ). 7. For patients at high risk of postpartum hemorrhage prophylactic intravenous oxytocin should be used ( conditional moderate ). 8. When given intravenously oxytocin can be given either as a rapid infusion (max rate 1 IU/min) for 4 minutes followed by 7.5 e15 IU/h or as a 3 IU intravenous rapid injection ( strong moderate ) 9. If there is inadequate response to oxytocin within 4 minutes a second-line uterotonic should be administered ( strong high ). 10. Carbetocin can be considered as a ﬁrst-line agent for postpartum hemorrhage prophylaxis at cesarean delivery ( strong moderate ). 11. Bimanual uterine compression and bladder emptying should be performed as ﬁrst-line measures while waiting for pharmacologic agents to take effect ( good practice point ). 12. Misoprostol (sublingual/oral) is an effective adjunct to prophylactic or therapeutic oxytocin in high-risk individuals ( strong high ) 13. Intramuscular ergotamine and intramuscular or intramyometrial carboprost can both be used to treat active postpartum hemor- rhage ( strong high ). 14. Rectal misoprostol is inferior to other routes (both in onset and in bioavailability) and should not be used ( strong moderate ). 15. Tranexamic acid can be used in all patients as an adjunct to ute- rotonics in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage and can be used as a prophylactic agent in patients at high risk for postpartumhemorrhage ( strong high ). 16. Uterine tamponade is an effective tool and should be considered for ongoing mild to moderate bleeding ( conditional moderate ). 17. If the placenta has not been expelled spontaneously in the 30 minutes following delivery measures should be taken to expeditedelivery of the placenta ( strong high ). 18. When there is ongoing bleeding examine the patient for the presence of clots retained placental tissue or genital tract lacer-ations ( good practice point ). 19. In the case of uterine inversion if immediate reversion is not possible transfer the patient to an operating room for uterinerelaxation and patient stabilization as required ( good practice point ) 20. If pharmacologic interventions have not controlled bleeding surgical intervention should be undertaken promptly(strong high ) 21. Compression sutures ligation of uterine or internal iliac arteries and uterine artery embolization are all effective interventions that can be considered; however hysterectomy should not be delayedin an unstable patient ( strong high ). 22. Severe obstetrical hemorrhage should be managed by a multi- disciplinary team consisting of obstetrics anaesthesia nursing and transfusion medicine ( strong high ). 23. An obstetrical massive hemorrhage protocol including de ﬁned roles and responsibilities of each team member should be used (strong moderate ). 24. Initial resuscitative and monitoring measures should include intravenous access /C22 electrocardiography oxygen saturation blood pressure placement of an indwelling urethral catheter euthermia and volume replacement with balanced crystalloid(good practice point ). 1294 lDECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022SOGC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at University of the Andes from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on August 19  2023.

Four units red blood cells should be given prior to other blood products in an actively bleeding patient who is approaching themaximum allowable blood loss unless the patient has a coagu- lation defect ( strong moderate ) 26. Fibrinogen levels should be measured in every moderate to severe case of postpartum hemorrhage and if <2 g/L should be replaced accordingly ( strong high ).27. A massive hemorrhage protocol with ratios of red blood cells to fresh frozen plasma to platelets of 1:1:1: or 2:1:1 canbe used in the absence of timely lab results ( strong moderate ). 28. Simulation training with all members of the multidisciplinary team should occur on a regular basis ideally by a trained facilitator (strong high ).

International data from high resource countries suggest the rate is closer to 10% when blood loss is actually measured 2 and this rate continues to rise with uterine atony being the primary cause.3 4The traditional de ﬁnition of blood loss as /C21500 mL with vaginal delivery or /C211000 mL with cesarean delivery (CD) is no longer suf ﬁcient as visual estimates have been found to be inaccurate even for experienced pro- viders.5 6In addition many women of reproductive age maintain normal vital signs despite blood loss beyond these amounts. Since these factors can lead to delays in treatment causing adverse maternal outcomes 7 8accurate and cumu- lative measurement of blood loss has emerged as the newstandard of care. 9 Prevention is key to reducing maternal morbidity from PPH as 60% of these patients have at least one identi ﬁable antepartum or intrapartum risk factor.10Assessment for these risk factors as well as early intervention are integral to mitigating potential adverse outcomes. This guideline provides a new approach to the early identi ﬁcation and management of PPH. Recommenda- tions are based on emerging data that highlight the suc-cesses of obstetrical hemorrhage toolkits and care bundles in reducing maternal morbidity and mortality. The California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative implemented a quality improvement initiative that led to a reduction in PPH of 20.8% compared with 1.2% in non- participating hospitals. 11This guideline presents an adapted model to prevent and manage PPH and com- prises the following categories: 1. RISK ASSESSMENT 2. RISK REDUCTION 3. RECOGNIZE AND RE-EVALUATE 4. REACT5. RESUSCITATE 6. REVIEW RISK ASSESSMENT Causes and Risk Factors The four Ts (tone tissue trauma thrombin) are well known. Evaluation of risk factors in each of these cate- gories is important to determine a potential cause of PPH (Table 1 ).Individualized risk should be documented in a checklist upon arrival to a labour unit and updated throughout labour and delivery (Appendix B ). Patients at high risk for PPH deliver in a facility with easy access to amassive hemorrhage protocol (MHP) that takes into consideration local blood product supply transport and access to specialist advice. Anemia Women with anemia (Hb <110 g/L) have less reserve to cope with PPH. Anemia may also reduce oxygen deliveryto myometrial muscles resulting in uterine atony. 12In addition iron is a necessary cofactor for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in muscle cells and iron deﬁciency itself may contribute to uterine atony.13 Iron de ﬁciency anemia is a signi ﬁcant health problem for women worldwide.14The prevalence of iron de ﬁciency anemia in pregnancy is estimated at 41% with higher rates in low socioeconomic populations.14A study conducted in Toronto Canada of pregnant women screened for iron deﬁciency anemia found that 91% of participants were iron deﬁcient (ferritin <50mg/L) with most having severe iron deﬁciency with a ferritin <20mg/L despite only 25% of participants having a hemoglobin level <110 g/L.15These ﬁndings highlight the fact that by the time a low hemoglobin is detected the iron de ﬁciency is profound. Both hemo- globin and ferritin should be measured antenatally. Anemia and iron de ﬁciency should be assessed and treated at or before 28 weeks gestation. Ferrous salts taken dailyor every other day on an empty stomach is the ideal method of iron supplementation. 16There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to routinely co-administer ascorbic acid (vitamin C).17Intravenous iron should be given if there is no response (increase in Hb of 10 g/L) within 2 weeks.18 Postpartum anemia contributes to fatigue postpartum depression poor bonding and poor lactation.19 20Oral iron supplementation should continue for at least 3 months postpartum and intravenous (IV) iron considered with hemoglobin <80 g/L regardless of symptoms.16ABBREVIATIONS CD cesarean delivery MABL maximum allowable blood loss MHP massive hemorrhage protocol PPH postpartum hemorrhage TXA tranexamic acid 1296 lDECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022SOGC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at University of the Andes from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on August 19  2023.

Accurate Measurement of Blood Loss Since visual estimates grossly underestimate the true volumeof blood loss it is recommended that labour units begin to accurately monitor and record ongoing bleeding .D r y weights of sponges towels sheets and other commonly soaked surfaces should be recorded on a standard form thatcan be accessed at any time to properly evaluate blood loss in any patient. Measuring amniotic ﬂu i di nt h ed r a p e( c a l i - brated cones are available) and wiping the ﬂuid off the ﬂoor before active bleeding begins will distinguish it from any postpartum bleeding. Whenever possible suction the am- niotic ﬂuid at CD prior to delivering the infant and docu- ment its volume. Everything suctioned after this point should be considered blood loss. Sponges towels and drapes should be collected and weighed. A record of cu- mulative blood loss for the ﬁrst 24 hours should be kept. Estimated blood loss should be replaced by quantitative (measured) blood loss ( Appendices C D E F ).

Since that time delayed cord clamping has become the standard of care as it improves neonatal outcomes without increasing the incidence of PPH.23 Furthermore in multiple trials and reviews controlledcord traction has been shown to only decrease the lengthof the third stage by 4-6 minutes and blood loss by <30 mL. 24e28Since there is limited evidence to suggest that expediting delivery of the placenta before 30 minutes reduces the risk of PPH in an uncomplicated delivery 22 the de ﬁnition of active management of the third stage of labour should be con ﬁned to the use of a uterotonic. Providers choosing to employ controlled cord traction should only do so after signs of placental separation and traction should be performed with uterine contraction as these measures reduce the risk of uterine inversion cord avulsion and partial detachment of the placenta. Although prophylaxis with oxytocin for all patients has been common practice a 2019 Cochrane review found no clear beneﬁt to routine uterotonics in terms of PPH or hemo- globin in women at low risk of PPH based on low quality evidence.29They concluded that women at low risk for PPHshould be given the necessary information regarding the beneﬁts and risks of active management of the third stage of labour in order to make informed choices about their care. Skin to skin contact may independently reduce the length of the third stage.30 Oxytocin Free Interval Prior to Cesarean Delivery The longer oxytocin is used for the induction or augmentation of labour the less responsive the uterus becomes to it. Tran et al. showed a statistically signi ﬁcant association between the length of the oxytocin free interval prior to CD and the total estimated blood loss with the greatest bene ﬁt after 1 hour.31While the reduction in blood loss in patients with a low BMI was not clinicallysigniﬁcant (7 mL/10-min recovery interval) the greatest beneﬁt was seen in women with a BMI >40 kg/m 2 where blood loss was reduced by 45 mL per 10-minute recovery interval up to a maximum of 450 mL at 99 minutes. In these women higher amounts and longer durations of oxytocin use were associated with an increased need for a second-line uterotonic agent. When maternal and fetal conditions are stable providing an oxytocin wash-out in- terval may be bene ﬁcial particularly when the patient ’s BMI is >40 kg/m2. Prophylactic Uterotonics ( Table 3 ) Oxytocin Numerous trials over more than 2 decades continue to show that oxytocin is the drug of choice for both the prevention and treatment of PPH.32Compared with pla- cebo ergometrine carboprost or misoprostol oxytocin isTable 2.

In an elective CD (no labour) as little as 1 IU of oxytocin can achieve uterine tonus. While similar studies have not been done in the context of a vaginal birth it is reasonable to assume that the uterus will be at least as responsive after vaginal delivery than after an intrapartum CD where studies show an IV bolus of 3 IU is sufﬁcient to cause maximal uterine tonus by 4 minutes. 40 Interestingly a rapid IV infusion will provide the same beneﬁt at 4 minutes when approximately 3 e4I Uo f oxytocin has entered the circulation.41 42 In order to avoid overdosing oxytocin the infusion should be put through a pump hung as a separate mini-infusion with only 4 IU in 100 mL. At this point an infusion of 7.5e15 IU/h is suf ﬁcient to maintain uterine tone; ahigher infusion rate or additional IV boluses will not provide any additional bene ﬁt. For high-risk patients or ongoing bleeding a second-line agent should be added. Oxytocin has known hemodynamic and cardiac side ef- fects (mainly ST depression from vasoconstriction of coronary arteries) that are seldom recognized after vaginal birth primarily because patients are not monitored to detect them and because the clinical signs are attributed to other causes. Fortunately these side effects are short lived; however they have contributed to maternal death indeveloped countries. 43 44When oxytocin is given quickly hypotension and ST changes begin to appear after as little as 1 IU is administered but do not become noticeable until 3 IU is administered; these signs are signi ﬁcant at /C215I U .40At 10 IU 50% of women will experience ST depression even non-pregnant non-anesthetized control patients.45These effects disappear when the 5 IU bolus is given over 5 minutes. Rapid IV bolus should therefore be restricted to 3 IU or less and an IV infusion is preferred. Carbetocin Carbetocin is a synthetic long-acting heat stable analogue of oxytocin with equivalent af ﬁnity for the oxytocin re- ceptor. A single prophylactic 100 mg dose given IV over 30 seconds to 1 min provides similar or better clinical effectsTable 3.

The product monograph states that severe preeclampsia/eclampsia is a contraindication to its use; however clinical trials in women delivering vaginally or by cesarean found carbe- tocin to be both safe and effective in this setting.49 50While carbetocin has not been studied as a therapeutic agent for active PPH it should be considered a ﬁrst-line agent for prophylaxis at CD. Emerging evidence suggests the use ofcarbetocin may also be considered as a ﬁrst-line prophy- lactic uterotonic at vaginal delivery. 51 RECOGNIZE AND RE-EVALUATE It is crucial for care providers to rapidly recognize wheninitial measures have not adequately controlled bleeding. Failure to discern both the extent and source of bleedingwill needlessly delay appropriate intervention. Recording quantitative blood loss and vital signs for every post- partum patient will help health care providers recognize when blood loss has moved between stages and can prompt intervention ( Appendix G ) RE-EVALUATE TONE Bimanual Uterine Compression and Bladder Emptying The basic manoeuvre of manually compressing the uterus simultaneously through the abdomen and the vagina can be life-saving and should be actively used until the phar- macologic agents take effect or surgical intervention is initiated. The lower uterine segment must be cleared ofclots to allow the uterus to contract. Catheterization should be an initial step in management of PPH as a full bladder can impair the uterus ’ability to contract.Special Agents Misoprostol PG E1is available in 100 and 200 mg tablets and can be given sublingually orally buccally vaginally and rectally. However an understanding of the pharmacokinetics of misoprostol borne out in clinical trials will quickly eliminate most of these routes for treatment of PPH52(Table 4 ). The 2018 Cochrane review of all uterotonic agents found misoprostol alone was superior to placebo but inferior to oxytocin for preventing PPH; however adding miso- prostol to oxytocin prevented the need for additionaluterotonics. 47 53When used as an adjunctive treatment misoprostol should be given sublingually as this route offers the highest bioavailability with a rapid onset and a moderate duration of action. Doses above 400 mg are not needed and in fact 200 mg may be suf ﬁcient.54Miso- prostol should not be given rectally as this route offers the lowest bioavailability and is associated with a maximum serum concentration that may not reach clinically signi ﬁ- cant levels.52 55While misoprostol is a valuable adjunct to both prophylactic and therapeutic uterotonics the inject- able agents (oxytocin ergometrine carboprost and TXA) have a more rapid onset and may be more useful as an independent agent in active PPH. The main side effects of misoprostol which are dose dependent are shivering and fever nausea vomiting and diarrhea. Tranexamic Acid TXA is an anti ﬁbrinolytic agent that inhibits the activation of plasminogen to plasmin. Given intravenously it has a half-life of 2 hours.56Side effects include nausea vomiting diarrhea seizures deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism though seizures and thrombosis have not been demonstrated in clinical trials of PPH.57Two separate randomized trials showed prophylactic IV TXA (after cord clamping in 1 trial and preoperatively in the other)Table 4.

Every 15-minute delay results in a 10% reduction of TXA ef ﬁcacy and immediate treatment im- proves survival by over 70% ( P<0.0001).63Prophylactic use (in addition to a prophylactic uterotonic agent) in in-dividuals at high risk of PPH (cesarean or vaginal delivery) is a reasonable option. For a summary of special agents seeTable 5 . Uterotonics for Treatment of Postpartum Hemorrhage Additional agents should be used whenever the initial agent has not produced suf ﬁcient uterine tone by 4 mi- nutes or concurrently with a prophylactic agent in patients with increased risk for PPH based on the ongoing checklist ( Table 6 ). Ergometrine Ergometrine or ergonovine is an ergot alkaloid which directly stimulates uterine and vascular smooth muscle to contract. It can be given intramuscularly or in life-saving circumstances as a slow IV injection. 64It is a potent uterotonic but in the setting of anemia and hypovolemia ergometrine can rarelyprecipitate coronary artery vasospasm and myocardial ischemia even in patients without pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors.65Ergometrine should not be used in patients with essential or gestational hypertension 66or in patients on HIV protease inhibitors.47 67 68Though undisputedly extremely effective potential adverse effects limit ergome- trine to a second-line agent. Carboprost Carboprost is a prostaglandin F 2athat causes contractions in myometrial and intestinal smooth muscle cells.69It can be given by intramuscular or intramyometrial injection butcannot be given intravenously. Its ef ﬁcacy is equivalent to oxytocin after either cesarean or vaginal delivery but common adverse effects including nausea vomiting diarrhea and fever limit its use to a second-line agent. 34 70 Loperamide should be given concurrently with carboprost to counteract its diarrheal effects. As a member of the F class of prostaglandins carboprost can cause broncho- spasm and should not be used in patients with asthma.71 Mechanical Options Tamponade Intrauterine compression may control mild to moderate blood loss. The Bakri balloon was designed for this pur- pose and its use prevents the need for further non- pharmacologic intervention in 75% e95% of cases.72 73It should be ﬁlled with 300 e500 mL of sterile solution left in situ for 8 e48 hours and then gradually de ﬂated.

If a Bakri balloon is not available any balloon device can be used. Alternatively systematically packing the uterus from cornua to cornua with laparotomy packs tied end to end may be considered; however this procedure requires more experience more anaesthesia and a second procedure to remove. It may also mask blood loss and increase the risk of infection. Packing should be used as a last resort until more de ﬁni- tive treatment can be initiated. A running record of accumulated quantitative blood loss and interventions should be easily accessible and visible to all members of the care team ( Appendix E F H I ). RE-EVALUATE SOURCE Retained Placenta Retained placenta occurs in 1% e3% of vaginal deliveries and is the second leading cause of PPH.74Risk factors are uterine atony an adherent placenta succenturiate lobe and a trapped placenta behind a closed cervix. Internationally recommendations for manual removal of the placenta varybetween 30 and 60 minutes based on studies from the 1990s showing no increase in PPH until at least 30 minutes had passed. 74The majority of placentas (95%) will deliver spontaneously by 18 minutes. A 2012 randomized controlled trial con ﬁrmed a previous observational study that found patients who had manual removal of the placenta earlier than 30 minutes had less blood loss.75 Similarly a large retrospective study (n >28 000) showedwaiting more than 30 minutes for placental separation increased the risk of blood transfusion more than three- fold.76More studies need to be done to be able to recommend the ideal time for manual removal of the placenta in a stable patient. Intraumbilical oxytocin (20 IU in 30 mL saline) miso- prostol (800 mg in 30 mL saline) or ergometrine (0.2 mg in 30 mL saline) as well as IV carbetocin (100 mg) or sub- lingual misoprostol (400 mg) all have similar ef ﬁcacy for expelling the placenta within 30 minutes of administration (62%e72%).77 78In the presence of heavy bleeding transfer to an operating room for manual removal of the placenta should be expedited and curettage with a large curette may be needed. There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend routine treatment with antibiotics.74 Lacerations Lacerations of the vagina or cervix or disruption of a uterine scar should be ruled out by a formal examination under anaesthesia and surgical repair of the injury should be completed. Vaginal packing may be required when generalized bleeding from a deep venous plexus pre- cludes proper repair. Re-opening the abdominal incision after CD to look for surgical bleeding should not be delayed.

If still attached the placenta should not be removed prior to reversion. Prompt replacement may be attempted; however hypovolemic shock occurs rapidly and the patient should be urgently transferred to an operating room if reversion cannot be accomplishedimmediately. Uterine relaxation with IV nitroglycerine in addition to vasopressors may be required to revert the uterus and reverse hemodynamic instability. If reversion is unsuccessful laparotomy may be required. Antibiotics and oxytocin should be given after reversion. REACT If previous measures fail to control bleeding urgent abdominal surgical exploration is required. Bimanual compression should be continued while preparations in the operating room are being made and surgery is about to begin. Uterine compression sutures (B-Lynch Cho) uterine artery ligation internal iliac artery ligation embo- lization and hysterectomy are possible interventions. This guideline is not an instruction manual for those not skilled at performing these procedures. Additional expertise should be sought urgently if the necessary procedure is beyond the skill set of the care provider. Compression Sutures The B-Lynch technique uses an absorbable suture on a large needle to create compression “suspenders ”which successfully treat intractable uterine atony 75% of the time. 80Adding a second suture can further decrease the need for hysterectomy.81Cho square compression sutures incorporating both anterior and posterior walls of the uterus have similar ef ﬁcacy.82 Uterine Artery Ligation The purpose of uterine artery ligation is not to obliterate blood ﬂow to the uterus but to temporarily slow it. Key aspects include bladder retraction (to prevent traction on both bladder and ureters caused by the suture) and use of an absorbable suture on a large needle to secure the uterine artery at the level of the isthmus (or 2 e3 cm below the uterine incision at CD). Ensuring 2 cm of myometrium isincorporated into the suture will bundle the uterine artery and vein and prevent complete occlusion of the uterine artery. A second suture can be used superiorly to further compress ascending branches of the uterine artery. Alter- natively if bleeding is predominantly coming from thelower uterine segment or cervical branches a second stitch placed 3 cm inferior to the ﬁrst can be used to compress descending branches of the uterine artery. This location increases the risk of ureteric entrapment and further bladder dissection should be performed. Radiologic or cystoscopic evaluation of ureteral patency is recommended. Bilateral Internal Iliac Artery Ligation Bilateral internal iliac artery ligation is extremely effective at controlling obstetrical hemorrhage (including followinghysterectomy) with numerous case series reporting suc- cess rates of 75% or higher. 83e85Unfortunately bilateral internal iliac artery ligation requires more skill and expe- rience. Retroperitoneal dissection to identify the bifurca- tion of the common iliac artery is followed by ligation of the internal branch at least 2 cm distal to the bifurcation with an absorbable suture. Bilateral internal iliac artery ligation reduces pelvic blood ﬂow by 49% but immediate increased retrograde ﬂow in collateral vessels prevents pelvic ischemia. Resumption of menses and demonstration ofﬂow in distal uterine arteries in 90% of women within 6 months suggests that fertility is preserved.86 Uterine or Internal Iliac Artery Embolization Embolization of either uterine or internal iliac arteries is highly effective and fertility sparing. When compared with hysterectomy blood loss and operative time are signiﬁcantly less.87 88The main drawbacks of embolization are the availability of an interventional radiology department and a patient with a stable blood pressure. If these conditions are met and bleeding is ongoing uterineartery embolization can be considered before proceeding to hysterectomy. Uterine artery embolization can also be considered post-hysterectomy for ongoing bleeding where a contributing vessel can be identi ﬁed. Uterine artery embolization is particularly useful for cases where bleeding is expected to be high and/or surgical treatment is expected to be dif ﬁcult (e.g. placenta previa accreta severe obesity or suspected intra-abdominal adhesions). In these cases an interventional radiology consult should be obtained pre-delivery and a plan established including the possibility of pre-deliveryplacement of arterial balloons. Hysterectomy In cases of massive obstetric hemorrhage hysterectomy can be life-saving and the biggest risk is waiting too long to perform it. Successive clamping of pedicles without tying them until the uterine arteries have been secured will allow faster control of bleeding. Con ﬂicting opinions on subtotal versus total hysterectomy preclude a DECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022 l1303PPH and Hemorrhagic Shock Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at University of the Andes from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on August 19  2023.

Packing the pelvis tightly with warm moist packs and leaving them in place for 24 e48 hours can provide the necessary time to reverse these factors. RESUSCITATE Resuscitation requires ongoing communication andteamwork involving the obstetrical care provider and anaesthesia and nursing teams. An algorithm including clinical signs and symptoms of PPH and hypovolemic shock and their treatments should clearly outline the re- sponsibilities of various team members in order to opti- mize maternal outcome 11(Appendix G ). PPH is an active ongoing process; lab results represent a point in time that has invariably passed. While formal lab tests can help tailor therapy waiting for results to initiate treatment can worsen patient outcomes.90Most parturi- ents are able to maintain hemodynamic stability despite considerable blood loss. The recommended hemoglobin level at which to transfuse has decreased over time. In 2003 the threshold was 80 g/L and as of 2021 theconsensus is 70 g/L; however with many patients able to tolerate hemoglobin as low as 50 g/L this threshold may change in the future. Patients with pre-existing anemia may tolerate lower hemoglobin levels better than those with acute anemia. Current recommendations suggest that vital sign changes and accurate measurements of ongoing blood loss should trigger resuscitation efforts. Escalation of care (with or without transfusion) should occur at blood loss intervals of 500 1000 and 1500 mL (mild/moderate/severe blood loss) so the team can respond appropriately if the patient is not tolerating theblood loss. Maximum allowable blood loss (MABL) 91is an invaluable tool to customize treatment of PPH and should be calculated for each individual patient and documented on the risk assessment form. This formula uses the patient ’s most recent hemoglobin level as the initial hemoglobin (Hbi) and the hemoglobin at which transfusion may occur if clinically indicated as the ﬁnal hemoglobin (Hb f); it in- corporates the patient ’s weight and total circulating blood volume and provides an individualized estimate of the patient ’s tolerable blood loss before transfusion shouldoccur. The equation assumes that volume losses have been replaced with balanced crystalloid. In a healthy pregnancy the total circulating blood volume is 100 mL/kg (range 90e200 mL/kg.) In obesity or volume-contracted states such as severe preeclampsia total blood volume should be estimated at 70 mL/kg.92 The actual calculation is: ðHbi-HbfÞ/C2Pt’s Weight ðkgÞ/C2Total Blood Volume ðmL=kgÞ ½ðHbiþHbfÞ/C20:5/C138 The following simpli ﬁed and more user-friendly version of this formula can be used to calculate MABL: MABL ¼WtðkgÞ/C2100/C2½Hbi-70/C138 ðHbiþ70Þ/C20:5 Hypotension tachycardia oliguria and altered mental status indicate hypovolemic shock and should be treatedaggressively. The “lethal triad ”of coagulopathy acidosis and hypothermia which occurs in hemorrhagic shock compounds the loss of volume and blood components. 8 (Appendix J ) Initial Steps Establish the following: /C15Two large bore IV catheters /C15Frequent BP monitoring (consider arterial line) /C15Continuous EKG /C15O2saturation monitor /C15Temperature probe /C15Foley catheter Oxygen Temperature Volume Oxygen supplementation of 8 e10 L/min will slow the onset of tissue hypoxia. Hypothermia increases the risk of mortality; keeping the patient dry using warmed blankets or forced air warmers and warming all ﬂuids will help maintain euthermia.93Initial volume resuscitation should use Ringer ’s lactate in a ratio of 1 e2 mL per 1 mL blood loss.94Higher volumes of crystalloid have been associated with poor maternal outcomes due to dilutional coagulopathy. At this time there is no evidence to promote the use of colloids over crystalloids as colloids are also associated with impaired coagulation. In the setting of ongoing massive hemorrhage red blood cell (RBC) administration should occur before total blood loss equals MABL. 1304 lDECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022SOGC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at University of the Andes from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on August 19  2023.

Transfusing RBCs is not without risk and ongoing transfusion medi- cine trials continue to demonstrate that the decision to transfuse must take into account the potential for harm. 92 Patients at high risk for PPH should have a blood type andscreening on admission to cross match blood if needed. O negative Kell negative emergency blood is the next best alternative to cross-matched blood. There is no absolutehemoglobin level at which transfusion must occur but maintaining a level between 70 and 90 g/L during active hemorrhage is recommended. 95 Transfusion should occur when hemorrhage is unre- sponsive to uterotonic measures and blood loss exceeds 150 mL/min ortotal loss is rapidly approaching the calculated MABL orwhen the patient develops symptoms of inadequate perfusion such as shortness of breath or tachycardia unresponsive to ﬂuid in the presence of he- moglobin less than 90 g/L. Fatigue alone is not a symptom that warrants trans- fusion.96Each unit of packed RBCs should increase the hemoglobin by 10 g/L. If 4 units of RBCs have been given and blood loss is ongoing activation of a MHP should be considered. Hemorrhage caused by uterine atony or birth-related trauma rarely requires additional coagulation factors or platelets unless the volume of blood loss is signi ﬁcantly greater than the MABL and/or dilu- tional coagulopathy occurs. Hemorrhage due to placental abruption amniotic ﬂuid embolism or disseminated intravascular coagulation consumes platelets and factors rapidly and replacement may be bene ﬁcial earlier in resuscitation.97Cell salvage does not increase the risk of amniotic ﬂuid embolism and should be considered when the risk for severe PPH is high.19Intravenous iron is an important adjuvant for a hemoglobin level <80 g/L once bleeding has settled.16 98 99 Platelets Platelet transfusion is necessary if blood loss is severe or if a consumptive coagulopathy develops. During active hemorrhage platelets should be transfused at a level of 75 /C2109/L in order to maintain a level above 50/C2109/L.19There is no evidence to support a ﬁxed ratio of platelets in obstetric hemorrhage; however it is acceptable to give 1 pooled dose of adult platelets (4 U platelets or 5 U in Québec) per 8 e10 U of RBCs transfused in the absence of lab data and with ongoinghemorrhage.100Each dose should raise the platelet count by 15e25/C2109/L. Fresh Frozen Plasma The goal of transfusion is to keep the INR <1.8. Donor plasma has less ﬁbrinogen than the 5 g/L typically seen in the plasma of healthy parturients and is not the ﬁrst choice for its replacement.19Although plasma provides additional clotting factors most healthy women with moderate ob-stetric hemorrhage do not require these factors. However using plasma in a ratio to RBCs of 1:2 or 1:1 as a global replacement may improve outcomes in severe hemor- rhage in trauma patients particularly if timely lab values are not available. Large volumes of plasma increase the incidence of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated cardiorespiratory overload (TACO). 101 Fibrinogen Fibrinogen levels <2 g/L are associated with poor out- comes and direct replacement below these levels is rec- ommended. Testing for ﬁbrinogen levels when blood loss is<1500 mL is not predictive of severe PPH and routine administration of ﬁbrinogen in the absence of hypo ﬁ- brinogenemia does not improve outcomes. Levels will drop more rapidly in the setting of abruption and amniotic ﬂuid embolism than in the setting of atony.94 96 97 Each unit of cryoprecipitate contains 150 e350 mg of ﬁbrinogen and a typical dose is 8 e10 U. Thawing is required prior to use and multiple donors are required for sufﬁcient amounts which increases the risk of transfusion reactions.102 103 Fibrinogen concentrates (RiaSTAP and FIBRYGA) do not require thawing provide accurate dosing and decrease both the requirement for other blood products and the incidence of circulatory overload.104Fibrinogen concen- trates also undergo viral inactivation and removal of an- tigens and antibodies. Four grams of ﬁbrinogen concentrate is equivalent to 10 units of cryoprecipitate and typically raises plasma ﬁbrinogen levels by 1 g/L (60 mg/ kg dosing).102 103 Massive Hemorrhage Protocol Originally designed for trauma patients MHP is now often used in the setting of obstetrical hemorrhage. In the trauma literature transfusing ﬁxed ratios of RBCs to fresh frozen plasma to platelets of either 1:1:1 or 2:1:1 after theﬁrst 4 units of packed RBCs has been shown to decrease mortality. 94 96 97 105 106Therapy based on lab values DECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022 l1305PPH and Hemorrhagic Shock Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at University of the Andes from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on August 19  2023.

Using a single blood loss volume to initiate an MHP may result in some patients being transfused too early and others too late. Whenever the blood loss is approaching the MABL and there is ongoing bleeding RBCs should be considered ﬁrst.94 96 97 105 106Canadian standard of care recommendations indicate that an MHP should be able to be mobilized and products delivered within 10 minutes.109If local resources cannot reliably meet this timeline consider initiating an MHP sooner. If the patient is stable and the bleeding is controlled after the initial 4 units of RBCs the MHP products can be returned. Coagulopathy does not occur in every PPH including massive PPH. When there is no coagulopathy there is no beneﬁt to transfusion of coagulation products. The etiology of the bleed matters as atony and trauma are less likely to require coagulation factor replacement than abruption abnormal placentation or amniotic ﬂuid embolism. Testing for coagulopathy rarely demonstrates abnormalities when the blood loss is <1.5e2 L. When coagulopathy is present in PPH hypo ﬁbrinogenemia is the most common etiol- ogy 102 103and commonly coexists with hypocalcemia. Ionized calcium less than 1.16 mmol/L (rather than routine or corrected calcium which may be normal) is the most accurate way to measure calcium status in a hemorrhaging patient and may be at least as important as ﬁbrinogen in terms of risk reduction.110Calcium chloride is the agent of choice to replace calcium as it contains 3 times the elemental calcium of calcium gluconate and does not require liver metabolism. Fresh frozen plasma and platelets are less commonly needed but may be included in the MHP  particularly after 4 to 8 units of RBCs respectively. Frequent monitoring of all these components (CBC PTT INR ﬁbrinogen ionized calcium) as well as magnesium electrolytes hypothermia and overall volume status are necessary components of any MHP . Tailoring therapy as early as feasible results in a patient-centred approach that isin keeping with the most up-to-date recommendations in transfusion medicine.Prothrombin Complex Concentrate Prothrombin complex concentrate contains vitamin Kedependent clotting factors and is indicated for reversal of vitamin K antagonists (warfarin). Apart from patients with known factor II or X de ﬁciencies in which case a hematologist should be consulted there is currently no role for prothrombin complex concentrate in the treat- ment of PPH. 96 97 105 Recombinant Activated Factor VII Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) provides a thrombin burst and stabilizes clots and should only be administered to patients with a ﬁbrinogen level >1g/L platelets >20/C2109/L and a near normal pH (7.4) and temperature (35.9/C14C). Given the absence of strong evi- dence of bene ﬁt and the serious risk of thrombosis rFVIIa should only be used in PPH as a last resort and in consultation with a transfusion medicine specialist or hematologist.96 97 105 REVIEW Quality care initiatives in many centres have clearly shown that strong teamwork and communication along with simulation training and debrie ﬁng after any signi ﬁcant PPH improve outcomes. Key components of teamwork include a process for standard and structured communi- cation effective use of clear language psychological safetywhere team members are not fearful of speaking up situational awareness and effective leadership 111 (Appendix K ). Debrie ﬁng after simulation led by a trained facilitator promotes improved learning outcomes and enhances future performance in the clinical setting.112Debrie ﬁng is more than feedback it is “an interactive bidirectional and reﬂective conversation ”113which will foster better communication and teamwork in subsequent clinical sce- narios. As experiencing PPH can be traumatic care pro-viders should have a conversation with the patient and their family to explain the events and answer any questions they have. Debrie ﬁng after a signi ﬁcant PPH should occur and should include all involved members of the health care team as well as a separate discussion with the patient and her family. CONCLUSION Although the acute treatment of PPH is key for any single patient the ongoing review practices is most important for 1306 lDECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022SOGC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at University of the Andes from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on August 19  2023.

Key words: Postpartum haemorrhage hemorragic shock  evidence-based clinical practice Colombia.  IntRoduccIón Las complicaciones hemorrágicas asociadas el em - barazo continúan como una de las principales causas de muerte materna en el mundo y en Colombia (1). La principal causa de hemorragia obstétrica es la hemorragia posparto. Según la Organización Mun - dial de la Salud (OMS) la incidencia promedio de la hemorragia posparto en el mundo es de 6 09% (IC 95%: 6 06-6 11); esta cifra varía con la metodolo - gía objetiva o subjetiva empleada para la medición del sangrado (10 55 y 7 23% respectivamente). La hemorragia posparto masiva es un evento que se presenta en 1 86% de los partos (IC 95%: 1 82- 1 9) y es la primera causa de muerte materna en el mundo. La incidencia en América Latina y el Caribe se estima en 8 9% según una revisión sistemática que evaluó este evento en diferentes regiones del mundo (IC 95%: 8 03-9 86) (2). Estos mismos es - tudios no confirmaron la influencia de los factores de riesgo asociados tradicionalmente a la hemorra - gia posparto como la multiparidad o el embarazo múltiple (3) y por el contrario en dos tercios de las mujeres que la sufren no se logra identificar ###3###427 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorra Gia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico ningún factor de riesgo asociado (4). En los países en vías de desarrollo el riesgo de morir a causa de una hemorragia posparto es de 1 por cada 1000 nacimientos en un periodo determinado mientras que en países desarrollados como el Reino Unido  el riesgo es 100 veces menor. Cada año en el mundo aproximadamente 14 millones de mujeres sufren de hemorragia posparto y de ellas 125.000 fallecen debido a la falta de reconocimiento de las causas y a deficiencias con el tratamiento oportuno y adecua - do (2). La hemorragia obstétrica no es solo la pri - mera causa de muerte materna sino que es también la primera causa de morbilidad obstétrica extrema (5). Las principales complicaciones derivadas de la hemorragia obstétrica incluyen el choque hipovo - lémico la coagulación intravascular diseminada y la disfunción o falla de órganos como el riñón el hígado y el pulmón. Las mujeres además se ven expuestas a los riesgos derivados de transfusiones masivas y a consecuencias como la realización de cirugías radicales como la histerectomía.

En el presente artículo se presenta una versión abreviada de la información contenida en la GPC de Embarazo y Parto referente a la sección de manejo de las complicaciones hemorrágicas asociadas al em - barazo en la que se muestra la evidencia relacionada para cada tema y se presentan las recomendaciones elaboradas por el GDG durante el proceso de de - sarrollo de esta GPC. El grupo desarrollador de la Guía (GDG) elaboró esta GPC durante 2011-2012 acorde con la Guía Metodológica para la elabora -ción de Guías de Atención Integral en el Sistema General de Seguridad Social en Salud colombiano  basándose en la evidencia científica disponible y sumando la participación activa de grupos de pa - cientes sociedades científicas y grupos de interés. En particular la evidencia de esta sección fue adap - tada de las GPC del Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) “Prevention and management of postpartum haemorrhage” (2009) (6) y de OMS “WHO guidelines for the mana - gement of postpartum haemorrhage and retained placenta” (2009) (7) y actualizada por medio de procedimientos sistemáticos tanto para la búsqueda y valoración de la evidencia como para la genera - ción de recomendaciones. El nivel de evidencia y la fuerza de las recomendaciones fueron expresadas por medio del sistema del Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).

Se recomienda realizar manejo activo del alumbramiento para disminuir la pérdida de sangre materna y reducir el riesgo de hemorragia posparto. Se recomienda utilizar de forma rutinaria oxitócicos profilácticos en el manejo del alumbramiento en todas las mujeres. Se recomienda la administración de oxito - cina 5 UI o 10 UI (según la presentación de oxitocina disponible) por vía intramuscular como medicamento de elección para profi - A A A ###4###Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013428 laxis durante el alumbramiento en mujeres que tengan parto por vía vaginal. Cuando exista un acceso venoso permea - ble puede administrarse oxitocina 5 UI o 10 UI en infusión lenta diluida en 10 mL de cristaloides en un tiempo no inferior a 3 min. Se recomienda el uso de 600 mcg de mi - soprostol por vía sublingual para profilaxis durante el alumbramiento cuando la oxito - cina no esté disponible. No se recomienda la administración por vía intrarrectal. No se recomienda el uso de ácido tranexá - mico para la prevención de la hemorragia posparto.  Se recomienda ligar y cortar el cordón um - bilical entre el segundo y el tercer minuto después del nacimiento en todos los recién nacidos a término y pretérmino que nazcan vigorosos.  Una revisión sistemática realizada en el año 2000 y actualizada en el 2011 que incluyó siete ECC con 8.247 gestantes encontró que el manejo activo del alumbramiento redujo el riesgo promedio de he - morragia primaria de 1.000 mL o más al momento del parto (RR = 0 34; IC 95%: 0 14-0 87) (10 11). Los resultados también mostraron una reducción en la hemorragia de 500 mL o más en la necesidad de transfusión y en el uso de uterotónicos terapéu - ticos. Asimismo hubo un incremento en la presión arterial y el vómito después del manejo activo.Una revisión sistemática que incluyó siete ECC con 5.800 pacientes comparó la profilaxis con oxitocina frente a no administrar uterotónicos. Los autores encontraron que la oxitocina redujo el riesgo de hemorragia posparto alrededor del 60% y la necesidad de uterotónicos terapéuticos alrededor del 50% (12). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó tres ECC con 1.671 pacientes evaluó el efecto de la admi -1++nistración de la oxitocina previa a la expulsión  de la placenta comparado con la administración de oxitocina después de la expulsión de la placenta en relación con el manejo activo del alumbramiento para prevenir la hemorragia posparto (13). No se encontraron diferencias significativas en la in - cidencia de hemorragia posparto (RR = 0 81;  IC 95%: 0 62-1 04) placenta retenida (RR = 1 54; IC 95%: 0 76-3 11) duración del tercer periodo del parto (DM = -0 30; IC 95%: -0 95 a 0 36) pér - dida de sangre (DM = 22 32 mL; IC 95%: -58 21 a 102 68) necesidad de transfusión sanguínea (RR = 0 79; IC 95%: 0 23-2 73) uso adicional de uterotónicos (RR = 1 10; IC 95%: 0 80-1 52) e incidencia de hemorragia posparto severa (RR = 0 98; IC 95%: 0 48-1 98). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó seis ECC con 9.332 pacientes evaluó la efectividad de la profilaxis con ergometrina-oxitocina comparada con oxito - cina en el tercer periodo del parto para prevención de la hemorragia posparto (14). Se encontró que la combinación de ergometrina-oxitocina oxitocina 5 UI y oxitocina 10 UI tiene eficacia similar en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto de más de 1.000 mL (combinación de ergometrina-oxitocina comparada con alguna dosis de oxitocina: OR = 0 78; IC 95%: 0 58-1 03; combinación de ergome - trina-oxitocina comparada con 5 UI de oxitocina: OR = 0 14; IC 95%: 0 00-6 85; combinación de ergometrina-oxitocina comparada con 10 UI de oxitocina: OR = 0 78; IC 95%: 0 59-1 04). En la hemorragia posparto de mínimo 500 mL hubo una leve reducción en el riesgo con la combinación de ergometrina-oxitocina frente a otras dosis de oxitocina (OR = 0 82; IC 95%: 0 71-0 95; combi - nación de ergometrina-oxitocina comparada con 5 UI de oxitocina: OR = 0 43; IC 95%: 0 23-0 83; combinación de ergometrina-oxitocina compara - da con 10 UI de oxitocina: OR = 0 85; IC 95%: 0 73-0 98). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 32 ECC con 42.621 pacientes evaluó el papel de las prostaglan -√ A A A 1++ 1++1++ 1++ ###5###429 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorra Gia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico dinas en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto (15). Se encontró que los uterotónicos inyectables convencionales fueron más efectivos que las pros - taglandinas para la profilaxis rutinaria y que la investigación sobre prostaglandinas en el contexto de la hemorragia obstétrica debe focalizarse en el tratamiento más que en la prevención (RR = 1 32; IC 95%: 1 16-1 51). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 4 ECC evaluó el efecto del misoprostol en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto (16). El estudio concluyó que el misoprostol no es tan efectivo en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto cuando se compara con la oxitocina en dosis de 10 UI por vía intravenosa (RR = 1 34; IC 95%: 1 16-1 55). Una revisión sistemática de 6 ECC con 3.941 pacientes evaluó el efecto de los alcaloides del cornezuelo del centeno en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto (17). Se encontró que el uso de estos agentes disminuyó la media de pérdida de sangre (DM = -83 03 mL; IC 95%: -99 39 a 66 66) así como la hemorragia posparto menor o igual a 500 mL (RR = 0 38; IC 95%: 0 21-0 69) y el uso de uterotónicos terapéuticos (RR = 0 25; IC 95%: 0 10-0 66). Los efectos adversos incluyeron elevación de la presión arterial y dolor después del parto que requirió analgesia.Una revisión sistemática enfocada en la efectivi - dad del ácido tranexámico en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto incluyó dos ECC con 453 pacientes y compara el uso de este agente (0 5 g y 1 g) con otros agentes o placebo en el tercer pe - riodo del parto (18). La pérdida de sangre mayor a 400 mL fue menor en mujeres que recibieron ácido tranexámico por vía intravenosa después del parto vaginal o cesárea (RR = 0 51; IC 95%: 0 36-0 72). A pesar de los resultados los autores concluyeron que se requieren más estudios para confirmar la eficacia y seguridad del ácido tra - nexámico en el escenario de la prevención de la hemorragia posparto.Una revisión sistemática que incluyó cinco ECC con 1.163 pacientes evaluó la carbetocina como agente profiláctico para la prevención de la hemo - rragia posparto (19). La carbetocina fue comparada con oxitocina o combinación de ergometrina-oxi - tocina y placebo en mujeres con parto por vía va - ginal y por cesárea. Se encontró que la carbetocina probablemente es tan efectiva como la oxitocina en la profilaxis del tercer periodo del parto aunque esta conclusión no está fundamentada en datos objetivos ya que la heterogeneidad de los ensayos incluidos tanto en diseño como en desenlaces no permitió la estimación combinada del efecto.Dos revisiones sistemáticas evaluaron el efecto del corte tardío del cordón umbilical como com - ponente del manejo activo del alumbramiento en relación con desenlaces maternos y neonatales.  Una de ellas que incluyó 29 ECC con 2.200 recién nacidos a término y pretérmino comparó el corte del cordón umbilical dentro de los 30 segundos después del nacimiento con el corte después de los primeros 30 segundos (20). Solo se encontraron diferencias en términos de la remoción manual de la placenta (RR = 0 45; IC 95%: 0 22-0 94). En - tre los recién nacidos pretérmino se encontró un riesgo de hemorragia intraventricular menor que en los recién nacidos a término (RR = 0 52; IC 95%: 0 28-0 98). La segunda revisión que incluyó 11 ECC con 2.989 recién nacidos comparó el corte tardío (definido como el corte después del primer minuto del parto) con el corte antes del primer minuto (21). No se encontraron diferencias en relación con la hemorragia posparto (RR = 1 22; IC 95%: 0 96-1 55). Sin embargo se encontró un incremento significativo en la necesidad de fotote - rapia por ictericia en los recién nacidos con corte tardío del cordón (RR = 0 59; IC 95%: 0 38-0 92). De igual forma hubo un incremento en los niveles de hemoglobina de los recién nacidos con corte tardío del cordón (DM = 2 17g/dL; IC 95%: 0 28 a 4 06) aunque este efecto no persistió después de seis meses de seguimiento.1++ 1++1++1++ 1++ 1++ ###6###Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013430 Una revisión sistemática evaluó el efecto del masaje uterino en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto identificando solo un ECC con 200 mujeres que comparó la realización del masaje uterino después del parto y antes de la expulsión de la placenta frente a no realizar ninguno de estos procedimientos (22). No se encontraron diferencias significativas en la pérdida de sangre de más de 500 mL (RR = 0 52; IC 95%: 0 16-1 67) ni en los casos de placenta re - tenida. Se encontraron diferencias en la pérdida de sangre a los 30 min y 60 min en el grupo de masaje uterino (30 min: DM = -41 6 mL; IC 95%: -75 16 a -8 04. 60 min: DM = -77 40 mL; IC 95%: -118 7a -36 09). La necesidad de uterotónicos adicionales se redujo en el grupo del masaje uterino (RR = 0 20; IC 95%: 0 08-0 50).  La evidencia indica que el manejo activo del alumbramiento disminuye la pérdida de sangre materna y reduce el riesgo de hemorragia pos - parto de más de 1.000 mL. El agente de elección para el manejo activo del alumbramiento debe ser  la oxitocina en una dosis de 5 UI o 10 UI; aunque la vía de administración más frecuentemente usada es la intramuscular el GDG consideró importante sugerir la posibilidad de administrar la profilaxis con oxitocina por vía intravenosa cuando exista un acceso venoso permeable dado que no hay evidencia que favorezca la vía intramuscular (IM) sobre la intravenosa (IV). La consideración del uso de otros agentes oxi - tócicos diferentes a la oxitocina requiere de mayor evidencia que soporte su uso en la práctica diaria. Aunque el misoprostol no es tan efectivo como la oxitocina para la prevención de la hemorragia pos - parto puede ser usado cuando la oxitocina no esté disponible. El efecto específico del masaje uterino con uterotónicos o sin estos en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto requiere más ensayos con ma - yor número de participantes para evaluar su eficacia en estos casos. Por otra parte retrasar el corte del cordón umbilical por al menos 2 o 3 min parece no incrementar el riesgo de hemorragia posparto.2. ¿cuál es la intervención más efectiva para prevenir la hemorragia posparto en una paciente sometida a cesárea? En mujeres con parto por cesárea se reco - mienda la administración de un bolo de 5 UI de oxitocina diluidas en cristaloides por vía IV en un tiempo no inferior a 3 min inmediatamente se extraiga el bebé. En mujeres con parto por cesárea se reco - mienda adicionar una infusión de 30 UI de oxitocina en 500 mL de cristaloides para pasar en 4 horas inmediatamente después de la administración del bolo inicial de 5 UI de oxitocina. Cuatro ECC que incluyeron un total de 1.155 mujeres evaluaron diferentes uterotónicos para la profilaxis en mujeres con parto por cesárea (23-26). Se encontró que la oxitocina 5 UI por vía intravenosa lenta es la opción recomendada por su disminución de la pérdida sanguínea y la reducción de la necesidad de uterotónicos adicionales (RR = 2 1; IC 95%: 1 4-3 0). Así mismo se encontró que una dosis de carbetocina es al menos tan efectiva como la oxitocina en infusión en la reducción de la pérdida de sangre (RR = 2 03; IC 95%: 1 1-2 08) pero su uso rutinario no se recomienda actualmente por ser más costosa y por ser aún escasa la información. Se concluyó que el uso de la carbetocina parece asociarse a una disminución en el uso de oxitócicos adicionales pero no con la disminución de la incidencia de hemorragia pos - parto (RR = 0 74; IC 95%: 0 57-0 95). Tres ECC que incluyeron 155 pacientes compara - ron los diferentes regímenes de dosificación de la oxitocina en la prevención de la hemorragia pos - parto en mujeres sometidas a cesárea (27-29). Se encontró que las dosis actuales (siendo estas 5 y 10 UI) pueden ser más altas que la dosis efectiva necesaria para prevenir la hemorragia (dosis efec - tiva 90% 0 29 UI por min (IC 95%: 0 15-0 43). De A A 1++ 1++1++ ###7###431 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorra Gia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico igual forma la evidencia demuestra que dosis altas están asociadas con alteraciones hemodinámicas en las gestantes (FC = +28 Lat frente a + 52 Lat; p < 0 001; PAM: -33 mm/Hg frente a -30 mm/ Hg p < 0 001). Cuatro ECC que incluyeron 2.995 pacientes evalua - ron los efectos de la infusión continua de oxitocina en un tiempo de cuatro horas después de una dosis inicial de 5 UI (30-33). Se encontró disminución en el uso de uterotónicos adicionales (RR = 0 61 IC 95%: 0 48-0 78) mejoría de la contracción uterina inicial (DP = 2 8 frente a 2 2 p < 0 01) y reducción de la pérdida de sangre (RR = 0 35; IC 95%: 0 20-0 63); no se encontró alteración de los parámetros hemodinámicos de las mujeres so - metidas a cesárea. Tres ECC que incluyeron 500 pacientes evaluaron la efectividad del misoprostol en diferentes dosis y por diferentes vías para la prevención de la hemo - rragia poscesárea (34-36). Se encontró que en dosis de 200 mcg u 800 mcg por vía intrarrectal intrauterina o sublingual el misoprostol tiene una efectividad similar a la oxitocina en la disminución de la pérdida de sangre (608 91 mL frente a 673 9 mL; p = 0 048) y en la disminución de uterotó - nicos adicionales (34% frente a 14%; p = 0 032). Sin embargo los autores subrayan que se requieren nuevos ensayos con poblaciones más grandes con el fin de confirmar los hallazgos obtenidos. Un ECC que incluyó 90 mujeres sometidas a ce - sárea evaluó la efectividad del ácido tranexámico frente a placebo para la prevención de la hemorra - gia posparto (37). En dosis de 1 g por vía intrave - nosa se encontró una reducción de la pérdida de sangre (28 02 mL frente a 37 12 mL; p = 0 000).Un ECC que incluyó 377 mujeres evaluó la efectivi - dad de la carbetocina como agente profiláctico para la prevención de la hemorragia poscesárea (38). Se administraron 100 mcg de carbetocina y se comparó con 5 UI de oxitocina por vía intravenosa. Los resul - tados mostraron que un mayor número de mujeres requirieron oxitócicos adicionales en el grupo de oxitocina (RR = 0 74; IC 95%: 0 57-0 95). 1++Un ECC que incluyó 104 pacientes comparó una dosis de 100 mcg de carbetocina frente a 10 UI de oxitocina en infusión de dos horas en la prevención de la hemorragia poscesárea (39). El promedio de sangre perdida después de la administración de carbetocina fue 30 mL menos que después de la administración de oxitocina y el porcentaje de pa - cientes con pérdida de sangre menor de 500 mL fue mayor en el grupo con carbetocina (81% frente a 55%; p = 0 05).  La evidencia indica que la oxitocina es el agente de elección para la prevención de la hemorragia posparto en mujeres sometidas a cesárea. Algunos estudios han subrayado que la dosis actualmente utilizada puede ser más alta que la necesaria para lograr el efecto deseado y por tanto estas dosis podrían producir cambios hemodinámicos im - portantes en la mujer. De igual forma la evidencia demuestra que la infusión de una dosis baja de oxitocina después de una dosis inicial reduce la necesidad de uterotónicos adicionales en cesárea  pero no afecta la ocurrencia general de hemorragia obstétrica mayor. Lo que es claro con la evidencia actual es que la adición de una infusión de oxito - cina en pacientes sometidas a cesárea electiva no afecta los parámetros hemodinámicos maternos ni durante ni después de la cirugía. Al parecer la carbetocina puede ser tan efectiva como la oxitocina en la reducción del sangrado después de parto por cesárea y en el uso de utero - tónicos adicionales no así para la hemorragia mayor de 500 mL. La ventaja que ofrece la carbetocina es la dosis única y no tener que utilizar infusiones adicionales. Recientemente la Comisión de Regu - lación en Salud publicó un estudio de efectividad seguridad y análisis económico de la carbetocina frente a la oxitocina en la prevención de la atonía uterina y hemorragia posparto de mujeres sometidas a cesárea.

En pacientes con factores de riesgo para acretismo placentario se recomienda realizar un ultrasonido con Doppler pla - cen tario por personal calificado para identificar la localización y el grado de inserción de la placenta. Se recomienda que el ultrasonido con Doppler se realice a una edad gestacional por encima del límite de viabilidad fetal. Si se diagnostica acretismo placentario se recomienda planear la atención del parto por un equipo multidisciplinario apropiado para el manejo de la condición específica de la paciente en una institución que cuente con las ayudas diagnósticas pertinentes  con disponibilidad de glóbulos rojos plas - ma plaquetas y crioprecipitado y el acceso a una unidad de cuidados intensivos. No existe evidencia suficiente para reco - mendar o rechazar la oclusión profiláctica con balones de insuflación en las arterias hipogástricas en pacientes con acretismo placentario.  Ocho series de casos que incluyeron 36 mujeres se enfocaron en las intervenciones con radiología profiláctica en forma de oclusión con balón o embolización de arterias pélvicas en relación con desenlaces como pérdida de sangre tiempo en unidad de cuidados intensivos requerimientos de transfusión y necesidad de histerectomía (41-47). Tres de estas series sugieren que la intervención radiológica profiláctica es benéfica mientras que una de ellas no encontró beneficios. Una serie de casos de 11 pacientes a quienes se les practicó oclusión bilateral de la arteria iliaca in - terna para el manejo de la placenta acreta reportó un 39 4% de disminución en la pérdida de sangre intraoperatoria y un 52 1% menos de sangre trans - fundida en comparación con 14 mujeres a quienes no se les realizó del procedimiento (48). Una serie de casos con 167 mujeres mostró que dejar la placenta en su sitio parcial o totalmente  sin intento de removerla se asoció con al menos un beneficio en 131 mujeres (49). La resorción espontánea de la placenta ocurrió en 87 casos con un tiempo promedio desde el inicio del trabajo de parto de 13 5 semanas. La técnica del ultrasonido resulta importante para realizar el diagnóstico antenatal de inserción anormal de la placenta y la planeación de la atención del parto. El GDG consideró que el ultrasonido con Doppler debe ser realizado por personal calificado  buscando identificar al máximo la localización y el grado de inserción de la placenta. Así mismo se consideró importante que estas ecografías se reali - cen en una edad gestacional donde haya viabilidad fetal para mejorar los desenlaces maternos y fetales. Dejar la placenta acreta en su sitio parece ser una alternativa más segura que removerla. El tratamiento conservador para la placenta acreta puede ayudar a las mujeres a evitar una histerectomía y presenta bajas tasas de morbilidad materna cuando se realiza en ins - tituciones con los equipos y los recursos adecuados. 4. ¿cuál es la intervención más efectiva para tratar la retención placentaria sin sangrado después de manejo activo del alumbramiento?

Se recomienda una única tracción luego de la administración de esta dosis de oxitocina. Si la atención de la mujer se está realizando en un primer nivel de atención y la placenta no se desprende con el manejo anterior se recomienda iniciar la infusión de 20 UI de oxitocina en 500 mL de cristaloides a 60 mL/hora (40 miliunidades/min) y remitirla.  Si la atención de la mujer se está realizan - do en instituciones de segundo y tercer nivel y la placenta no se desprende en 30 min después de administrar la segunda dosis de oxitocina se recomienda como alternativa a métodos invasivos la inyec - ción en la vena umbilical con técnica aséptica de 800 mcg de misoprostol di - sueltos en 30 cc de solución salina. No se recomienda la inyección de oxitocina o solución salina por vena umbilical para el manejo de la placenta retenida. Si después de la realización de las manio - bras antes descritas para el manejo de la placenta retenida sin sangrado no hay respuesta se recomienda hacer la extrac - ción manual teniendo presente el riesgo potencial de un acretismo. Un ECC que incluyó 50 pacientes con placenta retenida comparó el sulprostone frente a placebo para evaluar la frecuencia de remoción manual de la placenta (50). El ensayo fue suspendido antes de alcanzar el tamaño de muestra propuesto y el sulprostone fue dado al resto de las mujeres in - cluidas. Con los datos preliminares se evidenció una reducción del riesgo de remoción manual de la placenta (RR = 0 51; IC 95%: 0 34-0 86) y una disminución no estadísticamente significativa en el riesgo de la transfusión de sangre en el grupo de sulprostone. Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 15 ECC con 1.704 mujeres evaluó la inyección por vena um - bilical de agentes para el manejo de la placenta retenida como solución salina sola oxitocina más solución salina oxitocina más solución salina más expansor de plasma y prostaglandina más solu - ción salina (51). La solución salina sola no mostró diferencias significativas en la remoción manual de la placenta (RR = 0 99; IC 95%: 0 84-1 16). La oxitocina más solución salina comparada con manejo expectante no mostró reducción en la necesidad de remover manualmente la placenta (RR = 0 87; IC 95%:0 74-1 03). La oxitocina más solución salina comparada con solución salina sola mostró una reducción en la remoción manual re - ducción que no fue estadísticamente significativa (RR = 0 91; IC 95%: 0 82-1 00). La oxitocina más solución salina comparada con expansor de plasma no mostró diferencias significativas (RR = 1 34; IC 95%: 0 97-1 85). La prostaglandina más solución salina comparada con solución salina sola fue asociada con una reducción significativa en la incidencia de remoción manual de la placenta (RR 0 42; IC95%: 0 22-0 82). La prostaglandina más solución salina comparada con oxitocina más so - lución salina mostró una reducción significativa en la remoción manual de la placenta (RR = 0 43; IC 95%: 0 25-0 75). También se observó una reduc - ción del tiempo entre la inyección y la expulsión de la placenta (DM = -6 00; IC 95%: -8 78 a -3 22). Una revisión sistemática comparó el uso de toco - líticos solos o en combinación con uterotónicos con no intervención o con otras intervenciones  en el manejo de la placenta retenida en mujeres en quienes había fallado el tratamiento con oxitocina. (52). La revisión incluyó solo un ensayo clínico con 24 mujeres y los datos sugieren una reducción en la necesidad de remoción manual de la placenta (RR = 0 04; IC 95%: 0 00-0 66) así como una reducción de la pérdida de sangre durante el alum - bramiento con el uso de nitroglicerina sublingual  (Media = -262 5 mL; IC 95%: -364 95 a -160 05). √√ √ B A 1-1++ 1++ ###10###Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013434 La inyección por la vena umbilical de prosta - glandinas requiere de investigaciones adicionales  aunque los resultados de dos ensayos clínicos evi - dencian un impacto en la disminución de remoción manual de la placenta. El consenso de expertos de la “Guía de práctica clínica para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto y placenta retenida” publicada por la OMS (7) no halló evidencia que soportara el uso de uterotó - nicos para el manejo de la placenta retenida sin sangrado. Sin embargo este grupo recomendó la administración de una nueva dosis de oxitocina y realizar un nuevo intento de extracción por tracción controlada. Ante esto el GDG junto con el grupo de expertos consultados consideró importante subra - yar que no se debe mantener de forma persistente la tracción controlada del cordón y que es suficiente una sola tracción para procurar la extracción de la placenta retenida como coadyuvante a la adminis - tración de la oxitocina. Así mismo dadas las condiciones geográficas y la atención por niveles establecida en el sistema de salud es aconsejable diferenciar el manejo por niveles de atención. Para el primer nivel resulta importante no intentar más de una sola tracción y una dosis adicional de oxitocina. En su defecto  es recomendable iniciar una infusión de oxitocina y remitir la paciente a un nivel superior donde se pueda garantizar un manejo adecuado. El GDG también consideró que la extracción manual debe realizarse en una institución que cuente con los recursos necesarios para atender cualquier compli - cación derivada de un posible acretismo placentario. 5. ¿se recomienda el uso profiláctico de antibióticos cuando se realiza revisión manual de la cavidad uterina? Se recomienda administrar dosis única parenteral de cefalosporina de primera ge - neración inmediatamente antes de iniciar la extracción manual de la placenta.En caso de alergia documentada a los be - talactámicos se recomienda administrar clindamicina más gentamicina en dosis única.  En las instituciones que cuenten con per - fil microbiológico se recomienda elegir el antibiótico de acuerdo con dicho perfil. Una revisión sistemática enfocada en estudios de profilaxis antibiótica después de extracción ma - nual de la placenta no encontró ensayos clínicos centrados en este tema (53). No se encuentra evi - dencia de alta calidad para el uso de antibióticos profilácticos.  El consenso de expertos de la guía de práctica clínica para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto y placenta retenida de la OMS (7) recomendó el uso de cefalosporina de primera generación basa - dos en evidencia indirecta de estudios realizados en mujeres sometidas a cesárea y de muje res con aborto. El GDG consideró la necesidad de incluir otra posibilidad antibiótica en los casos de alergia documentada así como la importancia de contar con un perfil microbiológico que apoye de forma más segura la elección del antibiótico que se va a utilizar. 6. ¿cuáles son los criterios que determinan el inicio del manejo del choque hipovolémico? Para la identificación del grado de choque se recomienda la evaluación de los siguien - tes parámetros clínicos: •	Sensorio	(estado	de	conciencia). •	Perfusión	(color	de	la	piel 	temperatura	 de la piel y llenado capilar). •	Pulso.	 •	Presión	arterial.		 D√ √ 1++ D ###11###435 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorra Gia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico Se recomienda clasificar el grado del cho - que e iniciar el manejo con el peor pará - metro clínico encontrado. Una revisión de tema acerca del manejo del choque hipovolémico en pacientes con trauma indica que los principios del manejo y el tratamiento deben ser bien conocidos y entendidos. Esto incluye el reconocimiento de signos de hipoperfusión a ór - ganos vitales como hipotensión taquicardia entre otros (54). La evidencia narrativa retoma los signos de cho - que hipovolémico de la clasificación de Baskett (54)  enfatizando dos aspectos importantes: en primer lugar debido al aumento del volumen plasmático que ocurre en la mujer durante el embarazo cualquier porcentaje de pérdida representa para la gestante un volumen mayor que en la mujer no embarazada. En segundo lugar se debe tener en cuenta que las altera - ciones del pulso y la presión arterial son tardías en la mujer embarazada por tanto el estado de conciencia y la perfusión deben ser evaluados inicialmente. El GDG consideró que el estado de choque lo establece el peor parámetro encontrado después de evaluar a la mujer con hemorragia posparto. 7. ¿cuáles son las intervenciones más efectivas para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto con signos de choque? Se recomienda que cuando se diagnosti - que hemorragia posparto con cualquier grado de choque se active el protocolo de código rojo obstétrico que incluya simul - táneamente acciones en cuatro áreas de intervención: comunicación resucitación monitoreo e investigación de la causa y control del sangrado. En la hemorragia posparto con signos de choque se recomiendan las siguientes medidas: •	Alertar	al	personal	de	salud	entrenado	 en código rojo obstétrico. •	Asignar	a	un	miembro	del	equipo	el	re- gistro de los procedimientos realizados  la administración de líquidos medica - mentos y signos vitales; idealmente en formato preestablecido. •	Garantizar	la	disponibilidad	de	hemode - rivados alertar al laboratorio y activar el sistema de referencia. •	Evaluar	sistema	respiratorio. •	Administrar	oxígeno	suplementario	con	 máscara con bolsa reservorio mínimo a 10 litros por minuto.

Un estudio descriptivo con una población de 103 participantes entre enfermeras obstetras anes - tesiólogos y auxiliares de enfermería reconoce la estimación visual como un método para determi - nar la pérdida de sangre y facilitar la resucitación temprana minimizando el riesgo de coagulación intravascular diseminada y reduciendo la severidad del choque hemorrágico (55). En un estudio descriptivo con 62 pacientes se encontró que el promedio de pérdida de sangre estimada fue significativamente menor que la media de pérdida de sangre medida por algún método objetivo. Estos hallaz gos mostraron que la estimación visual de pérdida de sangre puede resultar inadecuada (56).  No se encontró evidencia relacionada con la eficacia de las intervenciones o los procedimientos complementarios necesarios para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto. Para la atención se deben considerar al menos cuatro componentes: la co - municación con todos los profesionales relevantes la resucitación el monitoreo e investigación de la causa del sangrado y las medidas para contrarrestar el sangrado. Estos componentes deben ser iniciados simultáneamente para brindar un cuidado óptimo. Es fundamental alertar tempranamente al grupo de profesionales pertinente para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto. El GDG consideró importante definir una forma estandarizada de activar el protocolo de atención y adoptar el nombre de código rojo obstétrico para nombrarlo. Así mismo es importante reorganizar las acciones de intervención ante una mujer con hemorragia posparto teniendo en cuenta las con - sideraciones de la GPC del RCOG (6). Es indispen - sable estructurar un enfoque de ABC que permita además de la resucitación la identificación de otros problemas. La urgencia y las medidas instauradas para la resucitación y el control de la hemorragia necesitan estar en la medida del grado del choque. Debe administrarse oxígeno en altas concentracio - nes sin tener en cuenta la concentración del oxígeno materno. Usualmente los niveles de conciencia y el control de la oxigenación mejoran rápidamente una vez el volumen de circulación es restaurado. Es indispensable establecer dos accesos veno - sos de buen calibre y tomar muestras de sangre para optimizar el manejo y la necesidad de terapia transfusional. Los componentes principales de la resucitación durante la hemorragia posparto son  la restauración del volumen de sangre y la capacidad de transportar oxígeno. El reemplazo de volumen debe ser llevado a cabo sobre la base de que la pérdida de sangre es a menudo subestimada (55 56). El cuadro clínico debe ser el principal deter - minante de la necesidad y urgencia de la transfusión de hemoderivados y no se debe perder el tiempo esperando los resultados de laboratorio (57 58). Una vez que el sangrado está bajo control se debe considerar transferir a la mujer a una unidad de cuidados intensivos o a una unidad de cuidados intermedios dependiendo de la severidad del san - grado. Es necesario el monitoreo médico continuo y el registro de los parámetros en el tiempo sugerido en formatos preestablecidos los cuales darán a los profesionales que intervienen en el manejo de la mujer señales visuales adecuadas sobre su evolución clínica.3 3 ###13###437 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorra Gia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico 8. ¿cuáles son las medidas más efectivas para la recuperación del volumen sanguíneo en el manejo del choque hipovolémico por hemorragia obstétrica? Se recomienda iniciar infusión de crista - loides calentados a 39 °C titulando cada 5 min la respuesta basada en los signos de choque: sensorio conservado llenado capilar < 5 seg pulso radial presente y presión arterial sistólica mayor de 90 mm/ Hg con bolos de 500 mL si alguno de los parámetros se encuentra alterado. Se recomienda utilizar soporte vasopresor si  la paciente continúa con inestabilidad hemo dinámica después de la reposi - ción de volumen y control del sitio de sangrado. La selección del vasopre - sor dependerá de los medicamentos  y la vía de acceso disponibles. Una revisión sistemática de 1988 actualizada en el 2011  que incluyó 38 ECC con un total de 10.842 pacientes evaluó el uso de la albúmina en la recupe - ración del volumen de pacientes críticamente enfer - mos (59 60). La mortalidad se estimó en un 18%. El riesgo estimado de mortalidad con la administración de albúmina fue (RR = 1 05; IC 95%: 0 95-1 16).Una revisión sistemática de 65 ECC con 11.549 pacientes comparó la efectividad de los cristaloides y los coloides en la resucitación y recuperación del volumen circulante en pacientes críticamente en - fermos (61). El riesgo de muerte para las diferentes intervenciones comparadas fue el siguiente: 23 en - sayos compararon albúmina o fracción proteica en plasma (RR = 1 01; IC 95%: 0 92-1 10); 17 ensayos compararon hidroxietil almidón ( Hydroxyethyl starch ) (RR = 1 18; IC 95%: 0 96-1 44); 11 ensayos com - pararon gelatina modificada (RR = 0 91; IC 95%: 0 49-1 72); nueve ensayos compararon dextrano (RR = 1 24; IC 95%: 0 94-1 65) ocho ensayos compararon dextrano en cristaloides hipertónicos (RR = 0 88; IC 95%: 0 74-1 05). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 23 ensayos clínicos y 3.212 pacientes evaluó el uso de 11 diferentes vasopresores en el manejo del choque hipovolémico (62). No se encontraron diferencias en términos de la mortalidad (RR = 0 95; IC 95%: 0 87-1 03); sin embargo fueron observadas más arritmias en los pacientes tratados con dopamina cuando se compararon con norepinefrina (RR = 0 43; IC 95%: 0 26-0 69). El uso de la albúmina y de coloides para el ma - nejo de la hemorragia posparto no se recomienda porque aunque no se encuentra evidencia directa en la obstetricia se considera que el manejo del choque hipovolémico puede no diferir entre pacientes con condiciones específicas y variadas. Según esto el riesgo de muerte de una mujer en el posparto con la administración de coloides puede ser similar al reportado en otro tipo de pacientes. Aunque no existe evidencia de la cantidad de volumen por transfundir la GPC del RCOG (6) propone un volumen total de 3 5 litros. El GDG y el grupo de expertos consultados consideró que iniciar con volúmenes altos sin hacer una medición frecuente de los cambios en los parámetros clínicos puede acarrear consecuencias en la recuperación de la mujer con choque hipovolémico; por este motivo  se sugirió la evaluación cada 5 min de la respuesta a la infusión de cristaloides para determinar la continuidad en la infusión de los mismos. Probablemente la elección de un vasopresor en pacientes con choque no influye sobre el resultado más allá del efecto mismo del vasopresor. Ante esta evidencia el GDG consideró que se pueden utilizar vasopresores una vez se halla verificado una adecua - da reposición de volumen y un control adecuado del sitio del sangrado pero sin que su uso retrase la implementación de otras medidas o una remisión a un nivel de mayor complejidad. Seleccionar uno u otro vasopresor dependerá de la disponibilidad de los mismos de la vía de acceso disponible para su administración y del entrenamiento del personal que lo vaya a utilizar. √ √ 1++ 1++1++ ###14###Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013438 9. ¿cuáles son las intervenciones más efectivas para el control de la hemorragia por atonía uterina? Para el control de hemorragia por atonía uterina se recomienda excluir otras causas de hemorragia posparto como retención de fragmentos de placenta o membranas laceraciones o hematomas vaginales o cer - vicales ruptura uterina hematomas de li - gamentos sangrado extragenital inversión uterina o coagulopatía. Se recomienda utilizar la nemotecnia de las 4 “T”: Tono Trauma Tejido y Trombina (coagulopatía). Si la causa de la hemorragia es la atonía uterina se recomienda implementar las siguientes medidas hasta que cese el san - grado o se defina la necesidad de otra in - tervención: •	Inserción	de	una	sonda	Foley	para	eva- cuar la vejiga. •	Compresión	uterina	bimanual. •	Administrar	5	UI	de	oxitocina	por	vía	IV	 lenta mientras se inicia una infusión de 30 UI de oxitocina diluida en 500 mL de cristaloides para pasar en 4 horas. •	Ergometrina	0 2	mg	por	vía	IM.	Repetir	 una sola dosis adicional después de 20 min. Puede continuarse 0 2 mg cada 4 a 6 horas máximo 5 ampollas en 24 horas (contraindicada en mujeres con hipertensión).  Se recomienda utilizar misoprostol 800 mcg por vía sublingual solo si no se cuenta con oxitocina o maleato de metilergono - vina para el manejo de la hemorragia pos - parto.  El ácido tranexámico en dosis de 1 g por vía IV se puede ofrecer como un tratamiento para la hemorragia posparto si: la admi -nistración de la oxitocina seguida de las opciones de tratamiento de segunda línea y el misoprostol no han logrado detener la hemorragia; o como complemento a la sutura de traumatismos del canal del par - to identificados como causa del sangrado (desgarros del canal del parto).  No se recomienda el uso de carboprost para el tratamiento de las mujeres con hemo - rragia posparto. Una revisión sistemática de 3 ECC con 462 pacien - tes evaluó diferentes medidas para el tratamiento de la hemorragia posparto con misoprostol (63). Dos ensayos compararon misoprostol 600 mcg y 1.000 mcg frente a placebo. El uso del misopros - tol no se asoció con una reducción significativa en la mortalidad materna (RR = 7 24; IC 95%: 0 38-138 6) la indicación de histerectomía (RR = 1 24; IC 95%: 0 04-40 78) el uso adicional de uterotónicos (RR = 0 98; IC 95%: 0 78-1 24) la necesidad de transfusión de sangre (RR = 1 33; IC 95%: 0 81-2 18) y la evacuación de productos retenidos (RR = 5 17; IC 95%: 0 25-107). Un ensayo mostró mejor respuesta clínica al miso - prostol rectal comparado con una combinación de syntometrina y oxitocina. No se encontraron ensayos con técnicas quirúrgicas intervenciones radiológicas o drogas hemostáticas para manejo después de uterotónicos. Dos series de casos que incluyeron 263 pacientes relacionadas con la efectividad del carboprost fren - te a otros agentes uterotónicos mostraron éxito en el control de la hemorragia posparto (64 65). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 3 ECC con 122 pacientes evaluó el uso del misoprostol en el tratamiento de la hemorragia posparto así como su vía y dosis óptima (66). Las vías de administración potenciales para el misoprostol incluyen la oral la sublingual la rectal o una combinación de estas. La dosis por vía oral no puede exceder los 600 mcg por el riesgo de hiperpirexia. Un régimen de 200 √B B B DD 1++ 3 1+ ###15###439 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorra Gia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico mcg oral más 200 a 400 mcg sublingual o rectal parecieran ser buenas opciones. Para la pérdida de sangre de 500 mL o más el riesgo relativo del misoprostol comparado con placebo fue 0 57 (IC 95%: 0 34-0 96). Un ECC que incluyó 1.422 mujeres con parto por vía vaginal y diagnóstico de hemorragia posparto por atonía uterina evaluó la efectividad de 600 mcg de misoprostol en adición a la oxitocina compa - rados con placebo (67). La proporción de mujeres con pérdidas de sangre superiores a los 500 mL o más en 60 min fue similar en ambos grupos (RR = 1 02; IC 95%: 0 79-1 32). Dos ECC con 1.787 mujeres compararon el miso - prostol en dosis de 800 mcg como medicamento de primera línea frente a la infusión de 40 UI de oxi - tocina en el tratamiento de la hemorragia posparto (68 69). En el primer estudio el sangrado fue con - trolado 20 min posterior al inicio del tratamiento asignado en 363 mujeres del grupo de misoprostol y 360 del grupo de oxitocina (RR = 0 99; IC 95%: 0 95-1 04). En el segundo ensayo se encontraron cifras de 440 mujeres del grupo de misoprostol y 468 mujeres del grupo de oxitocina para el mismo desenlace (RR = 0 94; IC 95%: 0 91-0 98).Un ECC que incluyó 144 mujeres en las que se administraron 4 g de ácido tranexámico en una hora y luego infusión de 1 g por hora por seis horas  comparado con placebo evaluó este medicamento como alternativa en el tratamiento de la hemorragia posparto (70). La pérdida de sangre fue menor en el grupo del ácido tranexámico (173 mL frente a 221 mL; p = 0 041). Un ensayo clínico en el que participaron 1.964 mujeres con parto por vía vaginal evaluó el masaje uterino solo frente a la administración de 10 UI de oxitocina por vía IM frente a la combinación de ambas intervenciones (71). La frecuencia de pér - dida igual o superior a 300 mL de sangre fue mayor en el grupo de masaje solo frente a la combinación de masaje y oxitocina (RR = 1 88; IC 95%: 1 29-2 74) o con la oxitocina sola (RR = 1 71; IC 95%: 1 11-2 61). El tratamiento debe estar acompañado por un examen clínico cuidadoso para comprobar que el útero en efecto está atónico y que las otras fuentes de sangrado tales como traumas y laceraciones genitales o inversión uterina han sido excluidas. La compresión uterina bimanual y el vaciamiento de la vejiga para estimular la contracción uterina repre - sentan la primera línea de manejo de la hemorragia posparto así como la compresión de la aorta que como medida temporal pero efectiva permite lograr tiempo en la resucitación con la reposición de volumen y en la elección del soporte quirúrgico apropiado. Aunque no existen estudios publicados que provean evidencia para estas intervenciones el consenso de expertos de la guía del RCOG (6) y de la guía de la OMS (7) soportan la continuidad de su uso. La evidencia no muestra que la adición de misoprostol sea superior a la combinación de oxi - tocina y ergometrina sola para el tratamiento de la hemorra gia posparto primaria. La oxitocina es preferida especialmente en mujeres con hiper - tensión previa o preeclampsia. Los resultados de ensayos clínicos muestran que el uso de una dosis de 800 mcg de misoprostol parece ser tan efectivo como la oxitocina cuando se usa para detener el sangrado posparto por sospecha de atonía uterina en mujeres que han recibido oxitocina profiláctica. El consenso de expertos de la guía del RCOG (6) sugiere una dosis no mayor a 5 UI de oxitocina por vía intravenosa lenta ya que tal recomendación está en concordancia con las guías de otras organizacio - nes. El GDG consideró importante adicionar una infusión de oxitocina que permita mejorar las con - tracciones uterinas y así lograr disminuir la hemo - rragia posparto. Por otra parte no consideró útil la inclusión de una recomendación para apoyar el uso del carboprost como medicamento en el manejo de la hemorragia posparto por atonía uterina debido a la ausencia de evidencia más consistente y de mejor calidad y por ser un medicamento que no se consigue en el país. El GDG consideró importante incluir el ácido tranexámico dentro de las recomendaciones pero 1++ 1++ 1++ 1++ ###16###Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013440 ajustando la dosis y aclarando que solo se debe usar cuando los demás agentes como la oxitocina  la ergometrina y el misoprostol no hayan sido efectivos. Así mismo por la ausencia de evidencia disponible no se recomienda una segunda dosis de ácido tranexámico. Se requieren más estudios para aclarar la efectividad del masaje en el escenario de la hemorragia posparto. 10. ¿cuáles son las intervenciones más efectivas para el control de la hemorragia posparto por atonía uterina sin respuesta  al manejo médico? Se recomienda iniciar medidas de hemos - tasia quirúrgica lo más pronto posible si el manejo inicial falla. Se recomienda que este tiempo no supere nunca los 20 min. Se recomienda el taponamiento uterino con balón hidrostático (incluye condón) como la primera opción quirúrgica para las mujeres con atonía uterina. Se recomienda administrar dosis única parenteral de cefalosporina de primera ge - neración inmediatamente antes de insertar el balón. En caso de alergia documentada a los be - talactámicos se recomienda administrar clindamicina más gentamicina en dosis única.  Se recomienda dejar una infusión de oxi - tocina de 30 UI diluidas en 500 mL de cristaloides para pasar en 4 horas. Se recomienda dejar el balón por un tiempo máximo de 24 horas y retirar en sitio donde se cuente con recurso humano calificado hemoderivados y quirófano.  No se recomienda realizar taponamiento uterino con gasa. Se recomienda aplicar las siguientes me - didas quirúrgicas conservadoras depen - diendo de las circunstancias clínicas y la experticia de quien atiende a la mujer: •	Suturas	hemostáticas	uterinas	(B-Lynch	 o sutura compresiva modificada). •	Ligadura	bilateral	de	arterias	uterinas. •	Ligadura	bilateral	de	arterias	iliacas	in- ternas. •	Embolización	arterial	selectiva.		 Se recomienda recurrir a la histerectomía prontamente cuando las medidas anterio - res fallen o las circunstancias clínicas lo indiquen desde el inicio (ejemplo: estallido uterino). Cinco series de casos que incluyen entre uno a 16 pacientes han reportado el uso de sonda Foley el balón de Bakri el catéter esofágico Sengstaken-Blakemore y el condón como taponamientos efectivos en el manejo de la hemorragia posparto por atonía uterina que no responde al tratamien - to médico (72-76). En las cinco series de casos se reportaron como exitosos los taponamientos para el control de la hemorragia posparto por atonía uterina.Una serie de casos con cinco pacientes reportó éxito en el manejo de la hemorragia posparto con suturas compresivas a través de la técnica de B- Lynch (77).Una serie de casos que incluye tres pacientes re - portó éxito en el manejo de hemorragia posparto con la técnica de B-Lynch (78).Tres series de casos que han incluido entre tres y 14 mujeres con hemorragia posparto por ato - nía uterina reportaron la efectividad en todos los casos manejados con diferentes tipos de suturas compresivas (79-81). Una serie de casos describió 110 mujeres con he - morragia posparto de varias causas a quienes se les realizó ligadura de la arteria iliaca interna como √C √ √C √ CC C 3 3 3 3 3 ###17###441 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorra Gia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico primera línea de intervención quirúrgica; 88 mu - jeres fueron sometidas a la ligadura de la arteria iliaca interna de forma terapéutica el 39% de las cuales requirieron histerectomía (82). Una serie de casos de 100 mujeres reportó un porcentaje de éxito del 90% con la embolización arterial selectiva para la hemorragia obstétrica (83). Cuatro series de casos subsecuentes han reportado éxito en 1 de 1 4 de 4  10 de 10 y 26 de 29 mujeres que han sido sometidas a esta intervención (84-86). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 46 estudios observacionales o series de casos con 664 pacien - tes evaluó los porcentajes de éxito de cada uno de los procedimientos quirúrgicos para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto (87). Los resultados acumulados no mostraron diferencias entre los porcentajes de la embolización arterial (90 7%) el taponamiento (84%) las suturas uterinas com - presivas (91 7%) y la ligadura de arteria iliaca o desvascularización uterina (84 6%). El uso de agentes farmacológicos no debe retrasar el recurso quirúrgico en los casos de he - morragia por atonía uterina. Una vez se toma la decisión la elección del procedimiento depende de la experiencia y la experticia del equipo de profesionales disponibles. Es importante tener en cuenta las aspiraciones reproductivas futuras de la mujer en la decisión de la secuencia apropiada de intervenciones. Las técnicas quirúrgicas tales como el taponamiento uterino y las suturas hemostáticas pueden detener el sangrado de forma inmediata y facilitar una pronta decisión con respecto a la necesidad de la histerectomía. La técnica B-Lynch como alternativa al manejo de la hemorragia pos - parto es invaluable y puede proveer un primer paso quirúrgico para detener la hemorragia cuando las medidas con oxitócicos han fallado. El GDG consideró importante incluir el ma - nejo antibiótico cuando se utiliza el taponamiento uterino con balón para el control de la hemorragia posparto bajo los mismos preceptos formulados en la revisión de la cavidad uterina y la extracción manual de la placenta. En relación con el tiempo durante el cual se debe dejar el balón se consideró que un máximo de 24 horas puede ser adecuado en ausencia de evidencia clara sobre este tópico. La histerectomía no se debe retrasar hasta que la mujer esté in extremis o mientras se intentan pro - cedimientos menos definitivos si el obstetra tiene menos experiencia en ellos. 11. ¿cuál es el mejor tipo de histerectomía indicada para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto? Se recomienda que el obstetra de acuer - do con su experticia la condición clínica particular de cada mujer y las condiciones técnicas del sitio operatorio defina el tipo de histerectomía que va a realizar. Una revisión sistemática de 24 series de casos que incluyó 981 mujeres en quienes se realizó histerec - tomía posparto de emergencia encontró que la his - terectomía total fue más común en las mujeres que tenían adherencia anormal de la placenta (88). La morbilidad materna reportada en cuatro estudios no mostró diferencias significativas entre la histe - rectomía subtotal (16 de 98) y total (15 de 49) (Z = 1 74; p = 0 08). El daño del tracto urinario fue la complicación más frecuente cuando se realizó histerectomía total comparada con subtotal pero esta diferencia no fue estadísticamente significativa (16 frente a 30%; p > 0 05). La técnica subtotal de histerectomía es la cirugía de elección en muchos casos; hay menos trauma en el cérvix y en el segmento inferior. Aunque no se encuentra diferencia en la morbilidad materna entre la histerectomía total y subtotal el daño del tracto urinario fue la complicación reportada con más frecuencia cuando se realizó histerectomía total comparada con la subtotal. Se considera que la experticia del clínico cobra relevancia en esta intervención ya que ante una hemorragia y un útero 3 2+ D 2+ ###18###Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013442 aumentado de tamaño la probabilidad de que una histerectomía sea total o subtotal dependerá de otros factores adicionales. 12. ¿cuáles son las intervenciones más efectivas para el control de la hemorragia posparto por acretismo placentario? Si la placenta no se separa con las medi - das habituales se recomienda no intentar separarla y remitir a una institución con capacidad resolutiva. El manejo médico o la histerectomía con placenta in situ están asociados con menor pérdida sanguínea que la separación. Si la placenta se separa parcialmente se re - comienda que la porción desprendida sea extraída y la hemorragia que se presente sea manejada de acuerdo con las recomen - daciones planteadas. Las porciones que no se desprenden pueden ser dejadas en su lugar pero la pérdida de sangre en tales circunstancias puede ser mayor y requiere el manejo de una hemorragia masiva de manera oportuna. En una serie de casos que incluyó 167 mujeres con placenta acreta en manejo expectante (definido como dejar la placenta parcial o totalmente en su sitio sin intento de removerla a la fuerza) se reportó éxito en 131 mujeres referente a la prevención del sangrado y a la realización de una histerectomía (49). A 18 mujeres se le realizó histerectomía y a otras 18 se les pudo retrasar este procedimiento por unas horas. La resorción espontánea de la placenta ocurrió en 87 casos y el promedio de tiempo desde el parto hasta la resorción fue  de 13 5 semanas.Dos series de casos que incluyeron 37 mujeres con placenta acreta que tuvieron cesárea reportan otros procedimientos como la ligadura las suturas y la oclusión en el manejo de la hemorragia posparto por acretismo placentario (48 89). Los resultados de estos procedimientos han sido positivos en la reducción de la pérdida de sangre (2.011 mL frente a 3.316 mL; p = 0 042) y en la media del volumen de sangre transfundida (1.058 mL frente a 2.211 mL; p = 0 005). El GDG consideró importante la opción de rea - lizar ligadura bilateral de la arteria uterina seguida de una sutura de B-Lynch en mujeres con acretismo placentario que desean preservar su fertilidad. De igual forma la opción de realizar oclusión perio - peratoria de la arteria iliaca interna si se cuenta con el recurso para realizarla puede ser adecuada. Como punto importante no se debe intentar tratar a estas pacientes en instituciones que no cuenten con recurso humano y tecnológico suficiente para manejar las complicaciones. Así mismo se consideró como punto funda - mental no intentar separar la placenta en lugares o instituciones donde no se cuente con personal y equipos necesarios y suficientes para atender el caso. Por tanto una remisión oportuna a una institución de mayor complejidad donde se pueda realizar la extracción de la placenta y al mismo tiempo el manejo de la hemorragia es vital para disminuir los riesgos de morbilidad y mortalidad. 13. ¿cuál es la intervención más efectiva para el manejo de la hemorragia obstétrica por abrupcio de placenta? Se recomienda que el manejo de la hemo - rragia obstétrica por abrupcio de placenta se realice en un nivel de alta complejidad búsqueda y tratamiento activo de la coa - gulopatía (considerar protocolo de trans - fusión masiva) y soporte vital avanzado. Una revisión sistemática de estudios de interven - ción no identificó ningún ECC para el manejo del abrupcio de placenta (90).D D 3 3√ 1++ ###19###443 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorra Gia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico Una serie de casos con 59 pacientes evalúo el manejo selectivo de las pacientes con abrupcio de placenta y determinó que la sobrevida neonatal se logra con una adecuada cesárea y con un peso fetal mínimo de 1.500 g (91). La escasa evidencia actualizada y de calidad sobre el manejo de la hemorragia por abrupcio de placenta lleva a considerar intervenciones muy generales y que indiscutiblemente van a estar supeditadas a la situación específica de cada mujer que presente el evento. El GDG consideró que en mujeres con abrupcio y feto muerto se debe evitar al máximo realizar una cesárea y se debe insistir en parto vaginal simultáneamente con el manejo integral de la situación. 14. ¿cuáles son las recomendaciones generales para el uso de hemoderivados en el tratamiento de la mujer con hemorragia obstétrica? Se recomienda realizar pruebas cruzadas en hemorragia posparto. En los casos en que las pruebas cruzadas no estén disponibles se recomienda ini - ciar con sangre tipo O negativo o sangre específica sin pruebas cruzadas hasta que la sangre específica con pruebas cruzadas esté disponible. Se recomienda en caso de choque hemo - rrágico grave abrupcio de placenta con feto muerto o coagulopatía intravascular diseminada (CID) clínicamente evidente aplicar un protocolo de transfusión masiva para servicios obstétricos. En aquellos sitios que tengan disponibili - dad se recomienda reponer glóbulos rojos  plasma fresco congelado y plaquetas en una relación 1:1:1.  En los sitios con limitación de recursos se pueden reponer glóbulos rojos y plasma fresco congelado en una relación 1 5:1. Se recomienda administrar concentrado de plaquetas si el conteo es menor de 50.000. Se recomienda administrar crioprecipitado si el fibrinógeno es menor de 1 g/L. No se recomienda utilizar algún filtro especial de sangre porque disminuye la velocidad de infusión. No existe evidencia en hemorragia obsté - trica para recomendar o rechazar el uso de factor VII recombinante. Una serie de casos que incluyó 27 pacientes some - tidas a cesárea evaluó el efecto de la autotransfusión a través de un proceso denominado rescate celular intraoperatorio mediante el cual la sangre perdida durante una cirugía es recolectada filtrada y lim - piada a fin de producir glóbulos rojos autólogos para transfundir al paciente (92). En el proceso se retiraron de forma efectiva sustancias como alfaproteína y líquido amniótico de 23 pacientes. Este procedimiento está siendo usado comúnmente en cirugía cardiaca ortopédica y vascular con  una reducción relativa de transfusión del 39% y una reducción del riesgo absoluto del 23% sin aparente impacto adverso en desenlaces clínicos. Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 45 estudios observacionales realizados en pacientes críticamen - te enfermos evaluó la eficacia de la transfusión de glóbulos rojos para 272.596 pacientes (93). Los resultados de la revisión indican que la transfusión de glóbulos rojos se asoció con mortalidad (OR = 1 7; IC 95%: 1 4-1 9). La infección nosocomial se asoció con la transfusión de glóbulos rojos en nueve estudios (OR = 1 8; IC 95%: 1 5-2 2). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 25 ensayos clínicos con 3.503 pacientes sin hemofilia evaluó la efectividad en el uso del factor VIIa para la pro - filaxis y el tratamiento de la hemorragia (94). No se encontraron diferencias en términos de morta - lidad con el uso profiláctico del factor VIIa (RR = 1 06; IC 95%: 0 5-2 24) pero hubo disminución en la pérdida promedio de sangre (DM = -243 mL; IC 95%: -399 a -146 mL). No hubo diferencias en 3 C C √ √ √C C C B 3 2+ 1++ ###20###Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013444 el uso del factor VIIa en el número de pacientes transfundidos (RR = 0 91; IC 95%: 0 81-1 02) como tampoco en el número de eventos adversos tromboembólicos (RR = 1 32; IC 95%: 0 84- 2 06). Respecto al uso terapéutico del factor VIIa no se encontraron diferencias para los desenlaces evaluados. No hubo diferencias en la reducción de la mortalidad (RR = 0 89; IC 95%: 0 77-1 03) ni en los eventos adversos tromboembólicos (RR = 1 21; IC 95%: 0 93-1 58). Otra revisión sistemática de intervenciones no encon - tró ensayos clínicos acerca del uso de intervenciones hematológicas para tratar la coagulación intravascular diseminada en el embarazo y en el posparto como una de las complicaciones más frecuentes en los eventos de hemorragia obstétrica (95). Si las pruebas cruzadas no están disponibles se debe brindar la mejor alternativa para restaurar la capacidad de transporte de oxígeno. La sangre tipo O negativo puede ser el camino más seguro para evitar una incompatibilidad transfusional. Cuando la pérdida de sangre alcance alrededor de los 4 5 litros y se hayan administrado grandes volúmenes de cristaloides habrá defectos en los factores de coa - gulación de la sangre y se tendrán que administrar algunos hemoderivados. El GDG consideró que la reposición de volumen con hemoderivados para mejorar la capacidad de transporte de oxígeno y corregir los problemas de coagulación debe hacerse en una relación 1:1:1. En instituciones donde la disponibilidad de he - moderivados no es muy amplia puede hacerse una reposición en una relación de 1 5 a 1. 15. ¿cuál es la indicación más efectiva para transfundir en ausencia de sangre O negativo? En ausencia de glóbulos rojos O negativo se recomienda iniciar con glóbulos rojos “O” positivo. Una serie de casos que incluyó 4.241 pacientes evaluó desenlaces como muerte y necesidad de transfusión masiva con la transfusión de glóbulos rojos (96). Solo 1.236 pacientes los recibieron sin pruebas cruzadas. En este grupo de pacientes hubo un incremento en la mortalidad (OR = 2 15; IC 95%: 1 58-2 94) y en la necesidad de transfusión masiva (OR = 11 87; IC 95%: 8 43-16 7) pero los grupos de comparación diferían en sus condiciones basales como edad y presencia de complicaciones.Una revisión de casos que incluyó 119 pacientes evaluó los resultados de la transfusión de 568 unidades de glóbulos rojos tipo “O” positivo sin pruebas cruzadas en la resucitación de pacientes con trauma (97). No se presentó ninguna reacción hemolítica aguda o sensibilización en mujeres jóve - nes. Dentro de las 24 horas del ingreso fallecieron 38 pacientes pero ninguna muerte fue atribuible a reacción transfusional o incompatibilidad sanguí - nea. Las complicaciones incluyeron arritmias (2 casos) SDRA (4 casos) y CID (7 casos). Ninguno de los casos de CID se relacionó con incompati - bilidad transfusional. En una serie de casos que incluyó 153 pacientes con trauma sometidos a transfusión de glóbulos rojos sin pruebas cruzadas (98) la tasa de mortalidad general fue de 45% la cual se incrementó a 52 y 100% en pacientes que recibieron cuatro y cinco más unidades de glóbulos rojos respectivamente. Aunque no todos los estudios relacionan las uni - dades transfundidas con los desenlaces presentados  parece claro que a pesar de brindar una seguridad relativa la transfusión de glóbulos rojos sin pruebas cruzadas y de sangre tipo “O” positivo en ausencia de sangre tipo “O” negativo se debe limitar y con - siderar en cada caso específico.1++ C3 3 3 ###21###445 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorra Gia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico 16. ¿cuáles son los aspectos logísticos para tener en cuenta en el manejo del choque hipovolémico por causa obstétrica? Se recomienda que las instituciones de salud que atienden partos cuenten con un protocolo o guía para el manejo de la he - morragia posparto. Se recomienda que las instituciones de sa - lud de primer y segundo nivel que atienden partos cuenten con un protocolo formal para la referencia de las mujeres a un nivel de mayor complejidad. Un estudio antes y después acerca de la implemen - tación de un sistema de auditoría en el manejo de las mujeres con hemorragia posparto encontró un aumento en la calidad de la adherencia a tres estándares: tipificación y realización de pruebas cruzadas establecimiento de la hemoglobina y el hematocrito y el diligenciamiento del registro de ingesta y eliminación de líquidos (99). No hubo cambios significativos en el seguimiento estrecho de signos vitales casos de mortalidad acceso venoso administración de fluidos y oxitócicos admi nistrados. El consenso de expertos de la Guía para el ma nejo de la hemorragia posparto y la placenta rete nida de la OMS (53) considera que la imple - mentación de un protocolo formal es un proceso complejo que requiere adaptaciones locales. 17. ¿cuál es la estrategia más efectiva para mejorar las habilidades del personal de salud en el manejo de la hemorragia obstétrica? Se recomienda entrenamiento en el ma - nejo de la hemorragia posparto a todo el personal que atiende partos.Se recomienda que el entrenamiento para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto se haga bajo la estrategia de simulación. A Un ECC que incluyó 106 unidades de maternidad en Francia evalúo la efectividad de una intervención combinada de educación visitas periódicas grupos de discusión recordatorios y revisiones con pares comparada con la difusión pasiva del protocolo de manejo en la incidencia de hemorragia pospar - to (100). El porcentaje de hemorragia posparto fue 1 64% en las unidades intervenidas frente a 1 65% en las unidades de control por lo que no se encontraron diferencias significativas. Algunos elementos del manejo de la hemorragia posparto fueron aplicados más frecuentemente en las uni - dades con la intervención como la ayuda de un grupo de expertos o la tendencia a una segunda línea de tratamiento farmacológico y el análisis de sangre a tiempo. Un ECC que incluyó 36 profesionales de la salud evaluó la enseñanza basada en lectura comparada con la enseñanza basada en simulación o la combi - nación de ambas para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto (101). Todos los equipos mejoraron en su desempeño y conocimiento. El equipo en el que se usó solo simulación fue el único grupo que demostró mejoramiento sostenido en el manejo clínico del caso confidencia habilidades de co - municación y conocimiento. Este mismo grupo reportó habilidades transferibles y menos ansiedad en emergencias subsecuentes. Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 609 estudios y 35.226 personas de diversas áreas de la salud comparó el entrenamiento basado en la simulación contra ninguna intervención. En comparación con la no intervención el entrenamiento por simulación se asoció con el conocimiento (RR = 1 20; IC 95%: 1 04-1 35) las habilidades de manejo del tiempo (RR = 1 14; IC 95%: 1 03-1 25) las habilidades de proceso (RR = 1 09; IC 95%: 1 03-1 16) las habilidades del producto (RR = 1 18; IC 95%: D D 3 AA (á) 1+ 1+ 1++ ###22###Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013446 0 98-1 37) los comportamientos del tiempo (RR = 0 79; IC 95%: 0 47-1 10) otros comportamien - tos (RR = 0 81; IC 95%: 0 66-0 96) y con efectos directos sobre los pacientes (RR = 0 50; IC 95%: 0 34-0 66) (102).  Aunque se requieren más estudios que permi - tan mostrar cambios positivos en la incidencia de complicaciones y de mortalidad a través del mejo - ramiento de habilidades técnicas comunicacionales y del conocimiento es claro que el camino hacia este propósito es el entrenamiento en escenarios de simulación y un acompañamiento continuo para el mantenimiento de las habilidades adquiridas. decLARAcIón de conFLIctos de InteRÉs El trabajo científico de investigación así como la elaboración de las recomendaciones incluidas en el presente documento fueron realizados de manera independiente por el Grupo Desarrollador de Guías (GDG) de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

All rights reserved. /C15https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.04.258OBJECTIVE: To compare the available evidence on intravenous oxytocin dosing regimens for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage following cesarean delivery. DATA SOURCES: We searched Ovid MEDLINE Embase Global Index Medicus Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials ClinicalTrials.gov  and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for eligible studies pub- lished until February 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included any randomized or nonrandomized study published in peer-reviewed journals that compared at least 2 different dosing regimens of intravenous oxytocin for postpartum hemorrhage prevention in women undergoing cesarean delivery. METHODS: Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcome was incidence of postpartum hemorrhage /C211000 mL. Other review outcomes included use of additional uterotonics blood loss and adverse maternal events. Data were analyzed according to the type of intravenous administration (bolus only infusion only or bolusplus infusion) and total oxytocin dose. A meta-analysis was performed on randomized trials and the results were reported as risk ratios ormean differences with 95% conﬁdence intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluations scalewas used to rate the certainty of evidence. Findings from dose-ﬁnding trials and nonrandomized studies were reported narratively. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies (7333 women) met our inclusion criteria and included 30 randomized trials and 5 nonrandomized studies. There were limited data available from the trials for most outcomes and the results were not conclusive. Compared with bolus plus infusion regimens bolus only regimens probably result in slightly higher mean blood loss (mean difference 52 mL; 95% conﬁdence interval 0.4 e104 mL; moderate certainty). Among the bolus plus infusion regimens initial bolus doses <5 IU may reduce nausea (risk ratio 0.26; 95% conﬁdence interval 0.11 e0.63; low certainty) when compared with doses of 5 e9 IU. Total oxytocin doses of 5 e9 IU vs total doses of 10 e19 IU may increase the use of additional uterotonics (risk ratio 13.00; 95% conﬁdence interval 1.75 e96.37; low certainty). Effects on other outcomes were generally inconclusive. CONCLUSION: There are limited data available for comparisons of IV oxytocin regimens for postpartum hemorrhage prevention following cesarean delivery. Bolus plus infusion regimens may lead to minor reductions in mean blood loss and initial bolus doses of <5 IU may minimize nausea. Bolus only regimens of 10 IU vs bolus only regimens of 5 IU may decrease the need for additional uterotonics however further comparative trials are required to understand the effects on other key outcomes particularly hypotension.

The aim of thissystematic review was therefore toidentify and compare IVoxytocin dosingregimens during CD and determinewhether any regimens are superior. Methods We conducted a systematic review inaccordance with the Preferred ReportingItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance 9(Appendix A). We followed a prespeci ﬁed protocol registered with the International Prospec-tive Register of Systematic Reviews(CRD42020175544) 10and outlined any deviations in Appendix B .E t h i c s approval was not required because thiswas a systematic review of publiclyavailable data. Eligibility criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) andnonrandomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) published in peer-reviewed journals were eligible for inclusionwithout date restrictions. Conferenceabstracts were not included. We includedstudies written in English and thosewritten in other languages if we were ableto obtain adequate translations.Eligible studies were those that included women who gave birth at anygestational age to a live or stillborn babyvia CD and included both planned andintrapartum CDs. Women were eligibleif they received IV oxytocin for PPHprevention either at or around the thirdstage of labor recognizing that admin- istration of oxytocin during the third stage may not be possible or practicalduring a CD particularly during anemergency CD. Studies comparing at least 2 different IV dosing regimens of oxytocin duringCD were eligible. Trials with coad-ministered interventions were eligible provided that the use of cointerventions was identical in all trial arms. Outcomes of interest We prespeci ﬁed 25 outcomes based on those used in the WHO recommenda-tions on uterotonics for PPH preven-tion 4the PPH core outcome set 11and the 2019 Cochrane network meta- analysis on uterotonics for PPH pre-vention. 5The primary review outcome was incidence of PPH /C211000 mL with secondary outcomes including PPH/C21500 mL maternal death severe maternal morbidity (intensive care unit[ICU] admissions) severe maternal morbidity (shock) use of additional uterotonics satisfactory uterine tone use of surgical or invasive nonsurgicalinterventions blood transfusion meanvolumes of blood loss change in he-moglobin measurements before vs afterbirth any adverse maternal events(including nausea vomiting headache hypotension chest pain myocardial ischemia cardiac arrythmia dyspnea bradycardia tachycardia or waterintoxication) breastfeeding at hospitaldischarge maternal sense of well-being and maternal satisfaction. Information sources search strategy and study selection A search strategy was developed inconsultation with an informationspecialist ( Supplemental Table 1 ). Be- tween February 14 2020 and February19 2020 we searched the following 7electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE Embase Global Index Medicus AJOG at a Glance Why was this study conducted? The World Health Organization guidelines state that there is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend a speci ﬁc oxytocin dosing regimen to prevent women from experiencing postpartum hemorrhage following a cesarean delivery. This sys-tematic review was conducted to identify and compare intravenous oxytocindosing regimens administered during cesarean deliveries and to determinewhether any regimens are superior. Keyﬁndings We found limited and generally low-quality data for most outcomes and further research is required. Bolus plus infusion regimens with an initial bolus dose of<5 international units (IU) may have minor bene ﬁts. Bolus only regimens of 10 IU vs 5 IU may decrease the use of additional uterotonics although the effects onadverse events (particularly hypotension) is unknown. What does this add to what is known? This study compared data on all oxytocin regimens administered during cesareandelivery for postpartum hemorrhage prevention. It provides valuable informationfor clinical guidelines and future research.ajog.org Systematic Reviews SEPTEMBER 2021 American Journal of Obstetrics &Gynecology 251 ###3###Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Cochrane CentralRegister of Controlled Trials ClinicalTrials.gov  and WHO Interna- tional Clinical Trials Registry Platform.Recovered citations were de-duplicatedusing Endnote (Clarivate Analytics Philadelphia PA) 12and imported into Covidence (Covidence Melbourne Australia)13for screening. Each unique citation was reviewed and independentlyassessed by 2 review authors (L.C.P. E.K.F. and M.C.) for inclusion initiallybased on titles and abstracts and then onthe full-text articles of potentially eligiblecitations. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or consultation with another reviewer (J.P .V.). We alsoscreened the reference lists of allincluded studies in addition to thereference list of the Gallos et al 5network meta-analysis for additional eligiblestudies. Data extraction and assessment of risk of biasFor each study 2 reviewers (L.C.P . E.K.F. M.C.) double-extracted data us-ing a predesigned and pretested elec-tronic spreadsheet (Google Sheets). Dataabout the study design year of publica-tion period of recruitment number of participants maternal age gestational age primary and secondary review out-comes and potential effect modi ﬁers (type of CD previous oxytocin admin-istration during childbirth and previousrisk for PPH) were extracted. Disagree-ments between the reviewers at the titleand abstract and full-text stages were 4% and 9% respectively and were resolved through discussion or consul-tation with another reviewer (J.P.V.). Weattempted to contact the study authorsfor all studies for which further infor-mation was required. Each included study was assessed for risk of bias by at least 2 review authors (L.C.P . E.K.F. M.C.). RCTs were assessed using the Cochrane Risk Of Bias 2.0(ROB 2.0 Cochrane London UnitedKingdom) tool 14and NRSIs were assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions(ROBINS-I Cochrane) tool. 15We made an explicit judgment about the overallrisk of bias for each included study. In addition we assessed the risk of bias ofblood loss measurements using a similarapproach to Gallos et al 5(Supplemental Table 2 ). Extracted data about the re- view outcomes from RCTs were enteredinto the Review Manager 5 software(Cochrane) 16for the meta-analysis. Data from NRSIs were reported narratively. Data synthesis We identi ﬁed the following 3 types of studies: comparative RCTs with /C212 arms dose- ﬁnding RCTs and NRSIs. Comparative randomized controlled trials. For comparative RCTs we ﬁrst assessed trial populations and methods usedbetween trials to judge whether theywere suf ﬁciently similar to warrant a meta-analysis. A random-effects modelwas used to assess all outcomes with >1 trial. Results from dichotomous datawere presented as a summary risk ratio (RR) with 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CI) and as mean differences (MDs) forcontinuous data. For all meta-analyseswe used the Grading of Recommenda-tions Assessment Development andEvaluation (GRADE) approach 17to rate the certainty of evidence as very low low moderate or high using GRADEpro software (Evidence Prime Inc Ontario Canada). 18We planned to assess publi- cation bias using funnel plots if there were10 or more studies included in the meta-analysis however this was not donebecause of the limited number of studies. We conducted separate meta-analyses for (1) type of IV administration (bolus only infusion only or bolus plus infu- sion) and (2) total oxytocin doseadministered. We calculated the totaloxytocin dose for each trial arm byadding all preplanned doses of oxytocindescribed in the study methods including any doses used in a bolus short infusion and maintenance infu- sion (studies were not included for analysis of total oxytocin dose if therewas insuf ﬁcient information to deter- mine the total dose). Considering theavailable evidence (and to standardizethe analyses) trial arms were groupedinto 5 total oxytocin dose categories ( <5 IU 5e9I U 1 0 e19 IU 20 e49 IU and/C2150 IU) for comparison in pairwise analyses. In addition among trials usingbolus plus infusion regimens we iden-tiﬁed trials that studied the effects of using different initial bolus doses byvarying the initial bolus dose whilekeeping the infusion component iden-tical between trial arms. Hence we also analyzed (3) the effects of different initial bolus doses among trials using bolusplus infusion regimens. To accomplishthis we grouped the initial bolus doses as<5 IU 5 IU or 10 IU for comparison in pairwise analyses. In line with the 2019 international consensus statement recommendation of a 2- to 4-hour maintenance infusion 8we performed a subgroup analysis on studiesthat used a maintenance infusion be-tween 2 and 4 hours only. Owing tolimited available data we were only ableto perform this for the analysis of initialbolus doses in a bolus plus infusionregimen. We planned to conduct subgroup analyses by type of CD (planned vsintrapartum) previous oxytocin admin-istration and previous risk of PPH however these were not possible becauseof limited available data. We performedsensitivity analyses for risk of bias (onlyincluding studies with an overall low risk of bias) and method of blood loss esti- mation (only including studies that usedcalculated or volumetric assessment ofblood loss). When making statements onthe effects of an intervention we adoptedstandardized language derived from San-tesso et al. 19 Dose- ﬁnding trials and nonrandomized studies.The dose- ﬁnding RCTs used a 1-arm up- and-down sequential allocation methodin which the oxytocin dose for the nextparticipant was adjusted according to theresponse of the preceding participant. 20 For example if the ﬁrst participant had a satisfactory response the next partici- pant was allocated either an equal orlower dose using a biased-coin technique.Dose- ﬁnding trials did not make explicit pairwise comparisons between dosingregimens hence ﬁndings from these trials were reported narratively. Eligible NRSIswere also reported narratively.Systematic Reviews ajog.org 252 American Journal of Obstetrics &Gynecology SEPTEMBER 2021 ###4###Results Study selection and characteristics The results of the search are summarizedin the PRISMA ﬂow diagram ( Figure 1 ). We identi ﬁed 9631 records of which 6626 records were excluded at the title and abstract screening stage and 195 at the full-text review stage. The mostcommon reasons for exclusion wereduplicate study (n ¼72) and wrong article type (n ¼37). No further articles were identi ﬁed through screening of the reference lists. In total 35 studies of 7333women were included. We found 30 RCTs of which 26 were comparative RCTs and 4 were dose- ﬁnding RCTs. We found 5 NRSIs of which 4 werecomparative and 1 was a dose- ﬁnding study. A summary of the study charac-teristics and an overview of study com-parisons are provided in Tables 1 to 4 andSupplemental Table 3 . Among the 26 comparative RCTs included 9 were at an overall high risk for bias and 15 were atlow risk for bias ( Supplemental Figures 1 and 2); the 4 dose- ﬁnding RCTs were assessed to be at an overall high risk forbias. Of the 5 NRSIs 2 were assessed tobe at an overall critical risk of bias andthe remaining 3 as at moderate risk (Supplemental Figures 3 and4). Comparative randomized controlled trialsWe identi ﬁed 26 comparative RCTs (64 trial arms) that included 5271 women.Of these 19 RCTs were 2-arm trials and7 RCTs were multi-arm trials (rangingfrom 3e6 arms). Sample sizes ranged from 28 e2069 women and 23 trials included women undergoing planned CD only. The types of IVadministrationsused were bolus only (14 arms) infusiononly (23 arms) and bolus plus infusion(27 arms). There were 26 different totaldoses of oxytocin used ranging from 1IUe260 IU. The most common total doses were 5 IU (11 arms) and 10 IU (8 arms). We could not calculate the total dose for 3 of the studies. 25 27 35Among those trial arms that used an infusioncomponent the total infusion durationranged from 5 minutes to 24 hours andthe rate of oxytocin administration var-ied from 0.7 IU per hour to 120 IU perhour. Among the 5 trials that compareddifferent initial bolus doses within a bolus plus infusion regimen the initial bolus doses ranged from 0.5 e10 IU. Dose- ﬁnding trials and nonrandomized studiesWe identi ﬁed 4 dose- ﬁnding RCTs (180 women). The sample sizes ranged from30e70 women. Two trials included women undergoing planned CD only and 1 trial included women undergoingintrapartum CD only. All studies usedeither an initial bolus or infusion fol-lowed by a maintenance infusion. Wefound 5 NRSIs that included 1840women with sample sizes ranging from41e1122 women. Of these 4 werecomparative studies (3 2-arm studies 1 3-arm study) and 1 was a dose- ﬁnding study. The most common type of IVadministration was bolus only (4 arms).Doses ranged from 3 e80 IU with the most common dose being 5 IU (2 arms). Outcomes The most commonly reported outcomes were the use of additional uterotonics (28 studies) and mean blood loss (20studies). No data were available for 7outcomes (maternal deaths ICU ad-missions shock water intoxication breastfeeding after discharge maternalsense of well-being and maternal senseof satisfaction ( Supplemental Table 4 ).FIGURE 1 Flow diagram PRISMA ﬂow diagram.

A total of 15 RCTs (3921 women)compared different types of IV admin-istration regimens ( Table 2  Supplemental Table 5 ). The incidence of PPH/C211000 mL was only reported for 1 comparison (bolus only vs bolus plusinfusion). Bolus only vs infusion only. In 5 RCTs (338 women) bolus only regimens werecompared with infusion only regimens.No study reported on the outcome ofincidence of PPH /C211000 mL. The effects of either dosing regimen on the use ofadditional uterotonics mean blood loss or maternal adverse effects (nausea vomiting chest pain and myocardial ischemia) are inconclusive because thecertainty of evidence was very low. Noother outcomes were reported. Bolus only vs bolus plus infusion. In 5 RCTs (4580 women) bolus only regi-mens were compared with bolus plusinfusion regimens. The effect of either dosing regimen on the outcome of incidence of PPH /C211000 mL was inconclusive because the certainty ofevidence was very low (4 trials of 2976women; RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.75 e2.76; very low certainty) although bolus onlyregimens slightly increased the meanblood loss (5 trials of 3068 women; MD 52 mL; 95% CI 0.4 e104 mL; moderate certainty) ( Figure 2 ) and decreased the incidence of satisfactory uterine tone (1trial of 145 women; RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.41e0.95; low certainty) ( Figure 3 ). There were no clear differences in themean change in hemoglobin (3 trials of 2260 women; MD e0.05 g/dL; 95% CI e0.27 to 0.17 g/dL; high certainty) or incidence of blood transfusion (3 trialsof 2870 women; RR 1.55; 95% CI 0.47e5.13; low certainty). The effects of either dosing regimen on the outcomesof incidence of PPH /C21500 mL use of additional uterotonics and maternaladverse effects (hypotension nausea and chest pain) were inconclusive because the certainty of evidence wasvery low. There were zero events re-ported for surgical or nonsurgical in-terventions vomiting bradycardia tachycardia and dyspnea. A sensitivityanalysis on risk of bias (including onlystudies at an overall low risk of bias) suggested no clear difference in mean blood loss. Infusion only vs bolus plus infusion. In 5 RCTs (442 women) infusion onlyregimens were compared with bolusplus infusion regimens. No study re-ported on the outcome of incidence ofPPH/C211000 mL. There were no clear differences in the incidence of satisfac- t o r yu t e r i n et o n e( 2t r i a l so f1 6 4women; RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.90 e1.06; low certainty) blood transfusion (1 trialof 145 women; RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.04e3.26; low certainty) or maternal adverse events (vomiting [1 trial of 60women; RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.06 e4.18; low certainty] headache [1 trial of 152 women; RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.01 e8.71; low certainty] hypotension [2 trials of263 women; RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.34e1.05; moderate certainty] cardiac arrythmia [1 trial of 60 women; RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.27 e8.34; low cer- tainty] and tachycardia [1 trial of 143 women; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.06 e15.04; low certainty]). The effects on use ofadditional uterotonics mean bloodloss and nausea were inconclusivebecause the certainty of evidence wasvery low. There were zero events re-ported for surgical interventions chestpain and dyspnea. Total oxytocin dose. A total of 17 RCTs (4663 women) compared different totaloxytocin doses ( Table 3 Supplemental Table 6 ). The outcome of the incidence of PPH /C211000 mL was reported for 2 comparisons ( <5I Uv s5 e9 IU and 5 e9 IU vs 20 e49 IU). Total oxytocin dose of <5I Uv s5 e9 IU.One RCT40(145 women) compared a total oxytocin dose of <5 IU with 5 e9 IU. It reported zero incidences of PPH/C211000 mL with either dosing regimen. The effects on the use of additionaluterotonics satisfactory uterine tone mean blood loss or maternal adverseevents (nausea hypotension chest pain) were inconclusive because the certainty of evidence was very low. There werezero events reported for blood trans-fusions vomiting bradycardia tachy-cardia and dyspnea. Total oxytocin dose of 5 e9I Uv s1 0 e19 IU.Three RCTs (177 women) compared a total oxytocin dose of 5 e9 IU with 10e19 IU. No study reported on the incidence of PPH /C211000 mL. The use of a total dose of 5 e9I Uv s1 0 e19 IU may result in a large increase in the use ofadditional uterotonics (2 trials of 137women; RR 13.00; 95% CI 1.75 e96.37;TABLE 4 Overview of study comparisons: initial bolus dose in a bolus plus infusion regimen Dose <5 IU 5 IU 10 IU <5 IU 1 RCT (90 women) /C150.5 IU vs 1 IU vs 2 IU343 RCTs (180 women) /C150.5 IU vs 1 IU vs 3 IU vs 5 IU22 /C152I Uv s5I U32 /C152I Uv s5I U42No studies 5 IU — No studies 1 RCT (87 women) /C155I Uv s1 0I U24 10 IU — — No studies Dose-ﬁnding studies (4 RCTs 1 NRSI) are not included in this table.

Two RCTs (331 women) compared a total oxytocin dose of 10 e19 IU with 20 e49 IU. Neither study reported on the incidence of PPH /C211000 mL. The use of a total dose of 10e19 IU compared with of 20 e49 IUprobably reduces chest pain (1 trial of 271 women; RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00e0.81; moderate certainty) (Supplemental Figure 5 ). There were no clear differences in the incidence of blood transfusion (1 trial of 271 women;RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.28 e2.62; low cer- tainty) satisfactory uterine tone (1 trialof 271 women; RR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00e1.09; moderate certainty) or tachycardia (1 trial of 271 women; RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.26 e2.69). The effects on the use of additional uterotonics mean blood loss nausea or vomiting wereinconclusive because the certainty ofevidence was very low. Total oxytocin dose of 20 e49 IU vs /C2150 IU.One RCT 36(321 women) compared a total oxytocin dose of 20 e49 IU with /C2150 IU. It did not report on the inci- dence of PPH /C211000 mL. The use of doses of 20 e49 IU compared with /C2150 IU may increase the use of additionaluterotonics (RR 2.07; 95% CI 1.42e3.01; low certainty) ( Supplemental Figure 6 ). There were no clear differ- ences in mean blood loss (MD 20 mL;95% CI e14 to 54 mL; low certainty) or hypotension (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.71e1.53; low certainty).Different bolus doses in bolus plus infusion regimens. A total of 5 RCTs using oxytocin regimens of bolus plus infusion(357 women) compared different initial bolus doses while keeping the infusion component identical for both trial arms(Table 4 Supplemental Table 7 ). Initial bolus dose of <5 IU vs 5 IU in a bolus plus infusion regimen. In 3 RCTs (180 women) in which a bolus plusinfusion regimen was used an initialbolus dose of <5 IU was compared with that of 5 IU. No study reported on the incidence of PPH /C211000 mL. Data from all 3 trials showed that initial bolus dosesof<5 IU may reduce nausea (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.10 e0.81; low certainty) (Supplemental Figure 7 ) but there were no clear differences in the use of addi-tional uterotonics (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.51e2.31; low certainty) or vomiting (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05 e1.04; low cer- tainty). The effect on mean blood losswas very uncertain owing to very lowcertainty about the evidence. There werezero events reported for surgical ornonsurgical interventions blood trans-fusions and maternal adverse events (chest pain cardiac arrythmia dyspnea hypotension).FIGURE 2 Bolus only vs bolus plus infusion: mean blood loss CI conﬁdence interval; IV intravenous; SD standard deviation.

One RCT24 (87 women) that employed a bolus plus infusion regimen compared an initialbolus dose of 5 IU with 10 IU. It did notreport on the incidence of PPH /C211000 mL and there were no clear differences in mean blood loss (MD 2 mL; 95% CI e135 to 138 mL; low certainty) cardiac arrythmia (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.01 e8.14; low certainty) or chest pain (RR 0.41;95% CI 0.08 e2.00; low certainty). There were zero events reported for surgical ornonsurgical interventions and dyspnea. We were largely unable to perform sensitivity and subgroup analyses owing to limited available data. However wheredata permitted these analyses no sig-niﬁcant effects were found except where otherwise described. Narrative synthesis. We reviewed dose- ﬁnding RCTs and NRSIs separately. Findings from thesestudies are inconclusive however wereport the main ﬁndings below. The re- sults were not reported as statistically signiﬁcant unless otherwise noted. Dose- ﬁnding studies. A total of 4 dose- ﬁnding RCTs (180 women) studied the different initial doses required to initiateuterine contraction when followed by amaintenance infusion. No study re-ported on the incidence of PPH /C211000 mL. The studies found that small doses (0.3 IU as a bolus or 0.27 e0.29 IU/min as a short infusion) may be adequate toprevent uterine atony during plannedCD 48e50and that higher doses of oxytocin may be required during intra-partum CD regardless of the type ofadministration. 47 50One dose- ﬁnding NRSI55(83 women) reported that small doses (1 IU as a bolus) may be adequateto prevent uterine atony with higher doses needed during intrapartum CD. Hypotension secondary to oxytocinadministration was noted in all studies however was not explored in relation tospeciﬁc doses or types of IV adminis- tration regimens.Nonrandomized studies.Type of intravenous administration. One study 52(1122 women critical risk of bias) compared bolus only with bolus plusinfusion regimens. It suggested that morewomen who received bolus only regi-mens experienced PPH /C211000 mL than women who received bolus plus infusionregimens greater use of additional ute-rotonics and increased incidence in blood transfusions. There were no sig- niﬁcant differences reported for any other outcomes. 52Another study53(454 women moderate risk of bias) comparedinfusion only with bolus plus infusionregimens. It did not report on the inci-dence of PPH /C211000 mL but suggested that women who received infusion only regimens experienced a greater overall decrease in hemoglobin levels. Total oxytocin dose. One study 54(73 women moderate risk of bias)compared a total oxytocin dose of 3 IUwith that of 5 IU. It did not report on theincidence of PPH /C211000 mL butsuggested more women who received 5 IU experienced vomiting whencompared with women who received 3IU. One study 52(1122 women critical risk of bias) compared a total oxytocindose of 5 IU with that of 10 IU and 15 IU.It suggested that increased doses of oxytocin may result in less PPH /C211000 mL the use of additional uterotonics andblood transfusions and may lead tomore satisfactory uterine tone. 52One study51(150 women critical risk of bias) compared a total oxytocin dose of 30 IUwith that of 80 IU. It did not report onthe incidence of PPH /C211000 mL but suggested that 30 IU may lead to a sta- tistically signi ﬁcant increase in the use of additional uterotonics and a decrease insatisfactory uterine tone. No signi ﬁcant differences were reported for any otheroutcomes including hypotension. Comment Main ﬁndings We identi ﬁed 35 studies of 7333 women comparing different IV oxytocin regi-mens for PPH prevention following CD.The evidence in general was limited anddata were lacking for most of the reviewoutcomes with the data from 11 studiesat high or critical risk of bias. We did not ﬁnd any clear differences in the incidence of PPH /C211000 mL although data were sparse for this outcome. Bolus plusinfusion regimens are possibly superiorto bolus only regimens in terms of asmall reduction in mean blood loss(around 52 mL) and increased uterineFIGURE 4 Total oxytocin dose of 5 e9I Uv s1 0 e19 IU: use of additional uterotonics CI conﬁdence interval.

In general we found noclear indication of a superior totaloxytocin dose (largely because of insuf-ﬁcient evidence). Although we found doses of 10 e19 IU is possibly better than doses of 5 e9 IU in terms of decreasing the use of additional uterotonics there were limited data on adverse maternal events (particularly hypotension). Ofinterest both studies used in the meta-analysis of this outcome exclusivelycompared 5 IU with 10 IU in a bolus onlyregimen. Oxytocin regimens were described using varying time intervals which complicated meaningful comparison. However available evidence suggeststhat when administering oxytocin in abolus plus infusion regimen initial bolusdoses of <5 IU may lead to less nausea but the effects of lower vs higher initialbolus doses on blood loss are not known.The infusion component of bolus plus infusion regimens most commonly continued for 2 e4 hours. Findings from nonrandomized studies although not conclusive owingto a greater susceptibility to bias werebroadly consistent with the ﬁndings of meta-analyses on RCTs. These generallyindicated that bolus plus infusion regi- mens may be superior to bolus only regimens and that higher oxytocin dosesmay be more effective but can increaseadverse maternal events. Among thebolus plus infusion regimens 4 dose-ﬁnding RCTs reported that small initial doses (0.3 IU as a bolus or 0.27 e0.29 IU/ min as a short infusion) may be adequate to prevent uterine atony during planned CD 48e50with higher doses required at intrapartum CD 47 50but the evidence was not conclusive and should be inter-preted with caution. Comparison with existing literature Ourﬁndings are broadly consistent with previous work on IV oxytocin dosing regimens for PPH prevention followingat CD including a 2012 systematic re-view 7of 7 RCTs (626 women) and a 2011 literature review.6Both reviews recom- mended the use of a small initial bolusdose (ranging between 0.3 and 3 IU) 6 7 with 1 review further recommending abolus plus infusion regimen.7Both re- views further reported more adversehemodynamic events with higher dosesof oxytocin which is consistent with ourﬁndings. Our ﬁndings are compatible with a 2019 international consensusstatement 8which recommends using a 1 IU bolus followed by a 2.5 e7.5 IU/h infusion over 2 e4 hours and the WHO recommendation of 10 IU oxytocinadministered IVor intramuscular duringall births with doses divided into a smallinitial IV bolus with subsequent infusionduring CD. 4However it is evident that good-quality trials comparing differentoxytocin dosing regimens are needed to guide practice. It is noteworthy to mention that national guidelines vary(Supplemental Table 8 ) probably reﬂecting the lack of clear evidence to guide practice. The 2017 AmericanCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-gists guidelines recommend using adilute IV infusion (bolus dose of 10 IU) for PPH prevention without speci ﬁca- tion for mode of delivery. 57Australian guidelines only recommend prophylac-tic oxytocin for all births without speci-fying a dosing regimen. 61Carbetocin is recommended in Canada during plan-ned CD 60and a bolus only oxytocin regimen is recommended in the United Kingdom.58French guidelines recom- mend a oxytocin bolus plus infusionregimen during CD however suggest aninitial bolus dose of 5 e10 IU. 59 Strengths and limitations We used a systematic and methodologi-cally robust approach to searching and analyzing literature without date or language restrictions. We included bothrandomized and nonrandomizedstudies which allowed for a more thor-ough and nuanced investigation ofoxytocin dosing regimens. We also pre-speciﬁed outcomes that aligned with WHO priority outcomes 4and the PPH core outcome set11and used the latest and more sophisticated iterations of theCochrane risk of bias tools (ROB 2.0 andROBINS-I). 14 15 Despite this evidence was generally limited for most outcomes. In a networkmeta-analysis by Gallos et al 5in which different uterotonic options werecompared the authors similarly described inadequate reporting ofadverse events in trials of uterotonics forPPH prevention. 5The international consensus statement by Heesen et al8 also called for further large studies onthis topic. 8Any such trials should be sufﬁciently powered for important health-related outcomes and should clearly specify the dosing regimen. Spe-ciﬁcally trials comparing different oxytocin doses of bolus plus infusionregimens should be conducted. Weconsider it particularly important thatfuture trials should report on theoutcome of PPH /C211000 mL an impor- tant outcome for clinical guideline de- cision making. We also found hypotension to be a poorly studied outcome despite dose-dependent hypotension being welldescribed. 21 29 42 46 62Among RCTs the effects of different dosing regimens onhypotension were generally either inconclusive or equivocal. No NRSI re- ported signi ﬁcant differences in the incidence of hypotension. However itwould not seem unreasonable to expectan increased incidence of hypotensionwith higher doses (particularly withbolus regimens) and it is likely that thecombination of a bolus plus infusion regimen allows doses to exceed 5 IU while avoiding signi ﬁcant hemodynamic instability. Indeed we consider itparticularly important to prioritizeresearch in this area. We also did not ﬁnd any clear evidence of diminishing returns from increasingdoses and/or longer time periods of infusion despite it also being well described. 22 26Again this was largely because of lack of good-quality data andis an area for which further research isrequired. We identi ﬁed a wide range of dosing regimens that added to the complexity ofthis analysis and likely contributed to high heterogeneity. Although we aimed to standardize comparisons by usingtotal oxytocin dose we were not able toaccount for other factors such as rate ofoxytocin administration or total infu-sion time. We acknowledge that our dosecategories are somewhat arbitrary although necessary to standardize andajog.org Systematic Reviews SEPTEMBER 2021 American Journal of Obstetrics &Gynecology 261 ###13###interpret comparisons. We also tried to minimize the effect of subjective judg-ments on blood loss by including this inour risk of bias assessment and per-forming sensitivity analyses. Finally the majority of studies included only women undergoing plan-ned CD with low risk of PPH. Hence these ﬁndings may not be generalizable to other higher-risk groups of womenwho may require a different oxytocinregimen. Conclusions and implications Based on current evidence the mostappropriate oxytocin regimen may be bolus plus infusion and an initial bolus of<5 IU although further trials are needed to con ﬁrm these conclusions. Bolus only regimens of 10 IU vs 5 IU maydecrease the use of additional utero-tonics however further research isrequired to understand the implicationson adverse events particularly hypoten- sion. In the absence of more robust evi- dence many current guidelines on PPHprevention following CD may warrantreconsideration. Further research isrequired particularly in women at highrisk for PPH for other important out-comes such as adverse maternal events breastfeeding and maternal well-being and satisfaction. Final conclusion This systematic review and meta- analysis of IV oxytocin dosing regimensfor PPH prevention during CDs identi-ﬁed a lack of data for several important outcomes. Future well-designed studiesare required to identify an optimaloxytocin dosing regimen for womenundergoing CD. Nevertheless available data suggest that an IV bolus plus infu- sion regimen with an initial bolus doseof<5 IU may be preferable. However the degree of certainty for the evidencewas generally low and further research isrequired to identify the optimal oxytocinregimen for PPH prevention duringCDs. - ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to acknowledge Patrick Condron (The University of Melbourne Melbourne Australia) for his assistance with the search strategy; Dr Rangi de Silva MBBS (Mercy Hos- pital for Women Heidelberg Australia) for herinsights on this topic; Dr Matthew Page PhD(Monash University Clayton Australia) and Dr Tari Turner PhD (Monash University) for their insights on data analysis; and Liz Comrie-Thomson (Burnet Institute Melbourne Australia) for her insights on the entire research process.

Included dyspnea and chest pain as additional secondary outcomesAdditional adverse events reported in some trials. Include only third stage administration of oxytocin Included administration of oxytocin at or around third stagePracticality considerations means oxytocin not always able to be delivered at third stage during CD. Random-effects model if I 2>30% Random-effects model for all analyses with >1 trial Given large heterogeneity of trials and as per Cochrane handbook random-effects model provided a more conservative estimate. Speciﬁc comparisons made between high dose vs low dose bolus and high dose vs low dose infusionWe further divided the comparison of studies into (1) type of IV administration and (2) total oxytocin doseusing the categories of <5 IU 5e9 IU 10e19 IU 20e49 IU /C2150 IU. Among studies comparing a bolus plus infusion regimen we further compared various initial bolus doses when followed by an infusion.The wide range of oxytocin regimens identiﬁed meant that our original approach of high and low dose was notpractical nor informative. GRADE approach used to rate certainty of evidence. More accurately report study ﬁndings and draw conclusions from the data. Subgroup analysis for studies with maintenance infusions lasting 2 e4 h includedExplore hypothesis proposed by Heesen et al 8that maintenance infusion should be run for 2 e4h .

The 2009 guideline was based on an earlier guideline on the management of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) developed in 1998 underthe auspices of the Scottish Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) andupdated in 2002. 1 Executive summary of recommendations Prediction and prevention of PPH What are the risk factors for developing PPH and how can they be minimised? Risk factors Risk factors for PPH may present antenatally or intrapartum; care plans must be modi ﬁed as and when risk factors arise. /check Clinicians must be aware of risk factors for PPH and should take these into account whencounselling women about place of delivery./check Women with known risk factors for PPH should only be delivered in a hospital with a bloodbank on site.D Minimising risk –treating antenatal anaemia Antenatal anaemia should be investigated and treated appropriately as this may reduce the morbidity associated with PPH. [ New 2016 ]D Minimising risk –reducing blood loss at delivery Uterine massage is of no bene ﬁt in the prophylaxis of PPH. [ New 2016 ]A Prophylactic uterotonics should be routinely offered in the management of the third stage of labour in all women as they reduce the risk of PPH.A RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e107 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

A higher dose ofoxytocin is unlikely to be bene ﬁcial.A For women delivering by caesarean section oxytocin (5 iu by slow intravenous injection) should be used to encourage contraction of the uterus and to decrease blood loss.B Ergometrine –oxytocin may be used in the absence of hypertension in women at increased risk of haemorrhage as it reduces the risk of minor PPH (500 –1000 ml).C For women at increased risk of haemorrhage it is possible that a combination of preventative measures might be superior to syntocinon alone to prevent PPH. [ New 2016 ] /check Clinicians should consider the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (0.5 –1.0 g) in addition to oxytocin at caesarean section to reduce blood loss in women at increased risk of PPH. [ New 2016 ]A How should PPH be managed? Identiﬁcation of the severity of haemorrhage Clinicians should be aware that the visual estimation of peripartum blood loss is inaccurate and that clinical signs and symptoms should be included in the assessment of PPH. [ New 2016 ]C Communication and multidisciplinary care Communication with the woman Communication with the patient and her birthing partner is important and clear information of what is happening should be given from the outset. [ New 2016 ] /check Who should be informed when the woman presents with PPH? Relevant staff with an appropriate level of expertise should be alerted of PPH. [ New 2016 ]/check The midwife in charge and the ﬁrst-line obstetric and anaesthetic staff should be alerted when women present with minor PPH (blood loss 500 –1000 ml) without clinical shock. /check A multidisciplinary team involving senior members of staff should be summoned to attend to women with major PPH (blood loss of more than 1000 ml) and ongoing bleeding or clinical shock. /check RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e108 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Blood transfusion There are no ﬁrm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion. The decision to provide blood transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment. [ New 2016 ] /check Selection of red cell units for transfusion Major obstetric haemorrhage protocols must include the provision of emergency blood with immediate issue of group O rhesus D (RhD)-negative and K-negative units with a switch to group-speci ﬁc blood as soon as feasible. [ New 2016 ]D If clinically signi ﬁcant red cell antibodies are present close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is essential to avoid delay in transfusion in life-threatening haemorrhage.

[ New 2016 ] /check Intraoperative cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in PPH associated with caesarean section and with vaginal delivery. [ New 2016 ]D Blood components Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) If no haemostatic results are available and bleeding is continuing then after 4 units of red blood cells FFP should be infused at a dose of 12 –15 ml/kg until haemostatic test results are known. [ New 2016 ]D If no haemostatic tests are available early FFP should be considered for conditions with a suspected coagulopathy such as placental abruption or amniotic ﬂuid embolism or where detection of PPH has been delayed. [ New 2016 ]/check If prothrombin time/activated partial thromboplastin time is more than 1.5 times normal and haemorrhage is ongoing volumes of FFP in excess of 15 ml/kg are likely to be needed tocorrect coagulopathy. [ New 2016 ]D Clinicians should be aware that these blood components must be ordered as soon as a need for them is anticipated as there will always be a short delay in supply because of the need forthawing. [ New 2016 ]/check Fibrinogen A plasma ﬁbrinogen level of greater than 2 g/l should be maintained during ongoing PPH. [New 2016 ]C Cryoprecipitate should be used for ﬁbrinogen replacement. [ New 2016 ]D Transfusion of platelets During PPH platelets should be transfused when the platelet count is less than 75 3109/l based on laboratory monitoring. [ New 2016 ]D Is there a role for antiﬁbrinolytic drugs? Consideration should be given to the use of tranexamic acid in the management of PPH.

The routine use of rFVIIa is not recommended in the management of major PPH unless as part of a clinical trial. [ New 2016 ] /check Monitoring and investigation in major PPH: what investigations should be performed and how should women be monitored? Full protocol for monitoring and investigation in major PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml) and ongoing haemorrhage or clinical shock: /C15immediate venepuncture (20 ml) for: –cross-match (4 units minimum) –full blood count –coagulation screen including ﬁbrinogen –renal and liver function for baseline /C15monitor temperature every 15 minutes /C15continuous pulse blood pressure recording and respiratory rate (using oximeter electrocardiogram and automated blood pressure recording) /C15Foley catheter to monitor urine output /C15two peripheral cannulae 14 gauge /C15consider arterial line monitoring (once appropriately experienced staff available for insertion) /C15consider transfer to intensive therapy unit once the bleeding is controlled or monitoring athigh dependency unit on delivery suite if appropriate /C15recording of parameters on a modi ﬁed early obstetric warning score (MEOWS) chart (see Appendix IV) /C15acting and escalating promptly when abnormal scores from a MEOWS chart are observed /C15documentation of ﬂuid balance blood blood products and procedures. What is the role of the anaesthetist in the management of PPH? The management of PPH requires a multidisciplinary approach: the anaesthetist plays a crucial role in maintaining haemodynamic stability and if necessary in determining and administeringthe most appropriate method of anaesthesia. [ New 2016 ]D What methods should be employed to arrest the bleeding? Clinicians should be prepared to use a combination of pharmacological mechanical and surgical methods to arrest PPH. These methods should be directed towards the causative factor. [ New 2016 ]D What pharmacological and mechanical strategies can be used? When uterine atony is perceived to be a cause of the bleeding then a sequence of mechanical and pharmacological measures should be instituted in turn until the bleeding stops. /checkD RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e111 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

If pharmacological measures fail to control the haemorrhage surgical interventions should be initiated sooner rather than later.D Intrauterine balloon tamponade is an appropriate ﬁrst-line ‘surgical ’intervention for most women where uterine atony is the only or main cause of haemorrhage.C Conservative surgical interventions may be attempted as second line depending on clinicalcircumstances and available expertise.C It is recommended that a laminated diagram of the brace suture technique be kept in theatre./check Resort to hysterectomy sooner rather than later (especially in cases of placenta accreta oruterine rupture) .C Ideally and when feasible a second experienced clinician should be involved in the decision for hysterectomy. /check How should secondary PPH be managed? In women presenting with secondary PPH an assessment of vaginal microbiology should be performed (high vaginal and endocervical swabs) and appropriate use of antimicrobial therapyshould be initiated when endometritis is suspected. [ New 2016 ]D A pelvic ultrasound may help to exclude the presence of retained products of conception although the diagnosis of retained products is unreliable. [ New 2016 ]C Surgical evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by an experienced clinician.D Risk management Training and preparation: what measures can be taken to ensure optimal management of PPH? Every maternity unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol for the management of PPH.[New 2016 ]/check All staff involved in maternity care should receive training in the management of obstetric emergencies including the management of PPH.B Training for PPH should be multiprofessional and include team rehearsals. [ New 2016 ]B All cases of PPH involving a blood loss of greater than 1500 ml should be the subject of a formal clinical incident review.D RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e112 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Purpose and scope Primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the most common form of major obstetric haemorrhage. The traditional deﬁnition of primary PPH is the loss of 500 ml or more of blood from the genital tract within 24 hours of the birthof a baby. 2PPH can be minor (500 –1000 ml) or major (more than 1000 ml). Major can be further subdivided into moderate (1001 –2000 ml) and severe (more than 2000 ml). In women with lower body mass (e.g. less than 60 kg) a lower level of blood loss may be clinically signiﬁcant.3The recommendations in this guideline apply to women experiencing a primary PPH of 500 ml or more. Secondary PPH is deﬁned as abnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally.4This guideline also includes recommendations speciﬁc to the management of secondary PPH. Women with pre-existing bleeding disorders and women taking therapeutic anticoagulants are at increased risk of PPH; this guideline does not include speciﬁc recommendations for the management of such situations or for managinghaemorrhage in women who refuse blood transfusion. Guidance on these topics is available from other sources. 5–8 This guideline has been developed primarily for clinicians working in consultant-led obstetric units in the UK; recommendations may be less appropriate for other settings where facilities resources and routine practices differ.There is increasing emphasis on the availability of births at home or in midwife-led units. 9Obstetricians and midwives should develop guidelines for the management of obstetric emergencies that may occur in the community including PPH. This is beyond the scope of this guideline. 10 This guideline is restricted in scope to the management of PPH; the management of antepartum haemorrhage is thesubject of the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 63. 11The prevention and management of PPH related to placenta praevia and placenta praevia accreta is addressed in Green-top Guideline No. 27 12while Green-top Guideline No. 4713 provides guidance on the appropriate use of blood and blood products in obstetric practice. 2. Introduction and background epidemiology Obstetric haemorrhage remains one of the major causes of maternal death in both developed and developingcountries. The 2011 –13 Conﬁdential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths and Morbidity report 3identiﬁed 13 direct deaths due to obstetric haemorrhage in the UK and Ireland; the report places obstetric haemorrhage as the second leadingcause of direct maternal deaths. The recommendations from the report focus on basic clinical skills with promptrecognition of the severity of a haemorrhage and emphasise communication and teamwork in the management ofthese cases. A systematic review 14suggests that there may be regional variation in the prevalence of PPH. Standardisation of the measurement of PPH is recommended so that data from different regions are comparable.15 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e113 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Identi ﬁcation and assessment of evidence This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-top Guidelines. The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE]) EMBASE Trip MEDLINE and PubMed (electronic databases) were searched for relevantrandomised controlled trials systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search was restricted to articles publishedbetween 2007 and September 2015. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)terms including all subheadings and this was combined with a keyword search. Search words included ‘postpartumh(a)emorrhage’ ‘factor VII’ ‘Syntocinon’ ‘carbetocin’ ‘carboprost’ ‘oxytocics’ ‘uterotonics’ ‘B-lynch suture’ ‘uterineartery embolism’ ‘bilateral internal iliac ligation’ ‘balloon Rusch’ ‘Sengstaken catheters’ ‘thromboelastography’ ‘thromboelastometry’ ‘ﬁbrinogen concentrate’ ‘point of care testing’ and the search limited to humans and the Englishlanguage. The National Library for Health and the National Guideline Clearinghouse were also searched for relevantguidelines and reviews. Guidelines and recommendations produced by organisations such as the British Committee forStandards in Haematology Transfusion Taskforce and national bodies were considered. Where possible recommendations are based on available evidence and the areas where evidence is lacking are annotated as ‘good practice points’. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading ofrecommendations may be found in Appendix I. 4. Prediction and prevention of PPH 4.1 What are the risk factors for developing PPH and how can they be minimised? 4.1.1 Risk factors Risk factors for PPH may present antenatally or intrapartum; care plans must be modi ﬁed as and when risk factors arise. /check Clinicians must be aware of risk factors for PPH and should take these into account whencounselling women about place of delivery./check Women with known risk factors for PPH should only be delivered in a hospital with a bloodbank on site.D A number of case –control studies have identiﬁed antenatal and intrapartum risk factors for PPH (see Appendix II) 16–26although most cases of PPH have no identiﬁable risk factors.27These risk factors have been summarised in a 2010 review.28Despite methodological limitations these studies provide a guide to levels of risk which can help clinicians in their discussions with women about setting for delivery (Table 1).The Conﬁdential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health 29has recommended that women with known risk factors for PPH should not be delivered in a hospital without a blood bank on site. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada has published a guideline on the prevention and management of PPH.30This summarises the causes of PPH as related to abnormalities of one or more of four basic processes –‘the four Ts’: tone trauma tissue and thrombin. The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony.27Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e114 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

The British Committee for Standards in Haematology33 has produced guidelines on the investigation and management of anaemia in pregnancy.

A higher dose ofoxytocin is unlikely to be bene ﬁcial.A For women delivering by caesarean section oxytocin (5 iu by slow intravenous injection) should be used to encourage contraction of the uterus and to decrease blood loss.B Ergometrine –oxytocin may be used in the absence of hypertension in women at increased risk of haemorrhage as it reduces the risk of minor PPH (500 –1000 ml).C For women at increased risk of haemorrhage it is possible that a combination of preventative measures might be superior to syntocinon alone to prevent PPH. /check Clinicians should consider the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (0.5 –1.0 g) in addition to oxytocin at caesarean section to reduce blood loss in women at increased risk of PPH.A Uterine massage A Cochrane review35analysed the effectiveness of uterine massage after birth and before or after delivery of the placenta or both to prevent PPH. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included and thereview found no signiﬁcant difference between groups.Evidence level 1+ Management of the third stage of labour Various Cochrane reviews have addressed prophylaxis in the third stage of labour for women deliveringvaginally. 35–38These have established that both active management and the use of prophylactic uterotonics in the third stage of labour reduce the risk of PPH. Active management of the third stage of labourinvolves the use of interventions (including the use of uterotonics early clamping of the umbilical cord andcontrolled cord traction) to expedite delivery of the placenta with the aim of reducing blood loss. Inexpectant management signs of placental separation are awaited and the placenta is deliveredspontaneously. A Cochrane systematic review 39found that for women at mixed levels of risk of bleeding active management showed a reduction in the average risk of maternal primary haemorrhage at time ofbirth (more than 1000 ml; average risk ratio [RR] 0.34 95% CI 0.14 –0.87) and maternal Hb less than 90 g/l following birth (average RR 0.50 95% CI 0.30 –0.83).Evidence level 1++ RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e116 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License ###12###However active management results in a lower birthweight reﬂecting a lower blood volume from early cord clamping.39A systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials40found that delaying clamping for at least 2 minutes is beneﬁcial to the newborn and that the beneﬁts extend into infancy. Therefore active management of the third stage that includes routine early clamping of the umbilical cord can nolonger be recommended. A detailed consideration of the literature relating to the timing of cord clampingcan be found in RCOG Scientiﬁc Impact Paper No. 14. 41Guidance from NICE9recommends that the umbilical cord should not be clamped earlier than 1 minute from delivery of the baby if there are noconcerns over cord integrity or the baby’s wellbeing.Evidence level 1+ Oxytocin and ergometrine –oxytocin McDonald and colleagues’ meta-analysis36addressed prophylactic ergometrine –oxytocin versus oxytocin for the third stage of labour. This review indicated that ergometrine –oxytocin (Syntometrine/C226 Alliance Chippenham Wiltshire UK) oxytocin 5 iu and oxytocin 10 iu have similar efﬁcacy in preventing PPH in excess of 1000 ml.Using the deﬁnition of PPH as blood loss of at least 500 ml ergometrine –oxytocin was associated with a small reduction in the risk of PPH (Syntometrine /C226versus oxytocin any dose; OR 0.82 95% CI 0.71 –0.95). There were major differences between ergometrine –oxytocin and oxytocin alone in the adverse effects of nausea and vomiting and elevation of blood pressure with ergometrine –oxytocin carrying a ﬁve-fold increased risk (OR 4.92 95% CI 4.03 –6.00). Thus the advantage of a reduction in the risk of minor PPH needs to be weighed against the adverse effects associated with the use of ergometrine –oxytocin.Evidence level 1++ An RCT 42using a primary outcome of any treatment of uterine atony or haemorrhage assessed whether or not a higher dose of oxytocin after vaginal delivery was more effective than a low-dose regimen in preventingPPH after a vaginal delivery. Compared with 10 iu administering 40 iu or 80 iu of prophylactic oxytocin didnot reduce overall PPH treatment when given in 500 ml over 1 hour for vaginal delivery. Evidence level 1+ Prostaglandins The use of prostaglandins for the prevention of PPH has been the subject of two Cochrane reviews.37 38 Neither intramuscular prostaglandins (such as carboprost a 15-methyl prostaglandin F 2aanalogue) nor misoprostol (a prostaglandin E 1analogue given orally or sublingually) were preferable to conventional injectable uterotonics (oxytocin and/or ergometrine) for routine prophylaxis.37Furthermore another systematic review43concluded that oxytocin is superior to misoprostol in the prevention of PPH.Evidence level 1++ Appraisal of the evidence from both the Cochrane reviews together with consideration of standard practice in the UK suggests that for women delivering vaginally oxytocin 10 iu by intramuscular injection is theregimen of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour. Intramuscular oxytocin should be administeredwith the birth of the anterior shoulder or immediately after the birth of the baby and before the cord isclamped and cut. This strategy has been endorsed in the NICE intrapartum care guideline. 9Evidence level 1+ Carbetocin A Cochrane review44has addressed the use of a longer-acting oxytocin derivative carbetocin in the prevention of PPH. Carbetocin is licensed in the UK speciﬁcally for the indication of prevention of PPH inthe context of caesarean delivery. Use of carbetocin resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in theneed for further uterotonics compared with oxytocin for those undergoing a caesarean but not for vaginaldelivery. However there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between carbetocin and oxytocin interms of risk of PPH.

Randomised trials 45–50have compared different uterotonics (oxytocin ergometrine –oxytocin misoprostol carbetocin and 15-methyl prostaglandin F 2a) for prophylaxis in women delivering by caesarean section. Appraisal of the evidence from these trials together with consideration ofstandard practice in the UK led the development group for the NICE caesarean section guideline 51to recommend oxytocin 5 iu by slow intravenous injection for prophylaxis in the context of caesarean delivery.Evidence level 1+ Tranexamic acid The use of tranexamic acid in the prevention of PPH in women considered to be at low risk of PPH wasaddressed in a Cochrane review. 52This found that blood loss greater than 400 or 500 ml was less common in women who received tranexamic acid in addition to the usual uterotonic agent after vaginalbirth or caesarean section in a dosage of 1 or 0.5 g intravenously. Tranexamic acid was effective indecreasing the incidence of blood loss greater than 1000 ml in women who had undergone caesareansection (RR 0.43 95% CI 0.23 –0.78; four studies; 1534 women) but not vaginal birth. Mean blood loss until 2 hours postpartum was lower in the group of women who received intravenous tranexamic acidpostpartum (mean difference /C077.79 ml; 95% CI /C097.95 to /C057.64; ﬁve studies; 1186 women). The authors of the Cochrane review on the use of tranexamic acid in the prevention of PPH conclude thatfurther studies are required to investigate the risk of serious adverse effects including thromboembolicevents and the use of tranexamic acid in women considered to be at high risk of PPH (see section 5.3.6). Evidence level 1++ 5. How should PPH be managed? 5.1 Identiﬁcation of the severity of haemorrhage Clinicians should be aware that the visual estimation of peripartum blood loss is inaccurate and that clinical signs and symptoms should be included in the assessment of PPH.C As visual estimation often underestimates blood loss 53 54more accurate methods may be used such as blood collection drapes for vaginal deliveries55and the weighing of swabs.56However a study57comparing visual estimation of blood loss with the use of a collector bag after vaginal delivery concluded that thelatter did not signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of severe PPH. Participating in clinical reconstructions mayencourage early diagnosis and prompt treatment of PPH. 58Written and pictorial guidelines may help staff working in labour wards to estimate blood loss.59Evidence level 2+ Clinical signs and symptoms of hypovolaemia should be included in the assessment of PPH. However clinicians should be aware that the physiological increase in circulating blood volume during pregnancymeans that the signs of hypovolaemic shock become less sensitive in pregnancy. 60In pregnancy pulse and blood pressure are usually maintained in the normal range until blood loss exceeds 1000 ml; tachycardia tachypnoea and a slight recordable fall in systolic blood pressure occur with blood loss of 1000 –1500 ml. A systolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg associated with worsening tachycardia tachypnoea and alteredmental state usually indicates a PPH in excess of 1500 ml. 61Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e118 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

It is of note that the severity of haemorrhage was not recognised in 11 of the 17 (61%) women who died.Evidence level 4 5.2 Communication and multidisciplinary care 5.2.1 Communication with the woman Communication with the patient and her birthing partner is important and clear information of what is happening should be given from the outset. /check PPH often occurs unexpectedly and can be very stressful for the woman and her partner or birth attendants; it is crucial that where feasible they are kept informed and reassured if appropriate of the clinical development andproposed management. 5.2.2 Who should be informed when the woman presents with PPH? Relevant staff with an appropriate level of expertise should be alerted of PPH./check The midwife in charge and the ﬁrst-line obstetric and anaesthetic staff should be alerted when women present with minor PPH (blood loss 500 –1000 ml) without clinical shock. /check A multidisciplinary team involving senior members of staff should be summoned to attend to women with major PPH (blood loss of more than 1000 ml) and ongoing bleeding or clinical shock. /check Early involvement of appropriate senior staff (including the anaesthetic team and laboratory specialists) is fundamental to the management of PPH. In minor PPH the ﬁrst-line staff should be alerted and in major PPH the followingmembers of staff should be called and summoned to attend: /C15an experienced midwife (in addition to the midwife in charge) /C15the obstetric middle grade /C15the anaesthetic middle grade /C15the on-call clinical haematologist with experience in major haemorrhage /C15porters for delivery of specimens/blood.

If the airway is compromised owing to impaired conscious level anaesthetic assistance should be sought urgently. Usually level of consciousness and airway control improve rapidly once the circulating volume isrestored. Establish two 14-gauge intravenous lines; a 20 ml blood sample should be taken and sent for diagnostic tests including full blood count coagulation screen urea and electrolytes and to cross-match packed red cells (4 units).The urgency and measures undertaken to resuscitate and arrest haemorrhage need to be tailored to the degree of shock (Table 2). The cornerstones of resuscitation during PPH are restoration of both blood volume and oxygen-carrying capacity. Volume replacement must be undertaken on the basis that blood loss is oftenunderestimated. 59 64Compatible blood (supplied in the form of red cell concentrate) to replace red cell loss should be transfused as soon as available if necessary. The clinical picture should be the maindeterminant of the need for blood transfusion and time should not be unnecessarily spent awaitinglaboratory results. 65 66Obstetricians should draw on the expertise of their colleagues in anaesthesia haematology and transfusion medicine in determining the most appropriate combination of intravenousclear ﬂuids blood and blood products for continuing resuscitation. Guidance from the British Committeefor Standards in Haematology 67summarises the main therapeutic goals of the management of massive blood loss as maintaining:Evidence level 4 /C15Hb greater than 80 g/l /C15platelet count greater than 50 9109/l /C15prothrombin time (PT) less than 1.5 times normal /C15activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) less than 1.5 times normal /C15ﬁbrinogen greater than 2 g/l.Table 2.

Switch to group-speci ﬁc red cells as soon as feasible. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) Administration of FFP should be guided by haemostatic testing and whether haemorrhage is continuing: /C15If prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are prolonged and haemorrhage is ongoing administer 12 –15 ml/kg of FFP. /C15If haemorrhage continues after 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs) and haemostatic tests are unavailable administer 4 units of FFP.

Traditionally a total volume of 3.5 l of clear ﬂuids (up to 2 l of warmed isotoniccrystalloid as rapidly as possible followed by up to a further 1.5 l of warmed colloid if blood is still notavailable) comprises the maximum that should be infused while awaiting compatible packed red cells. 1While there is controversy as to the most appropriate ﬂuids for volume resuscitation 68–70the nature of ﬂuid infused is of less importance than rapid administration and warming of the infusion.71The woman needs to be kept warm using appropriate measures to prevent hypothermia which in turn could exacerbate acidosis.72Evidence level 4 There have been no RCTs comparing the use of colloids with other replacement ﬂuids for the resuscitation of women with PPH. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO)73 recommend that intravenous ﬂuid replacement for PPH should be with isotonic crystalloids inpreference to colloids. A Cochrane review 74compared colloids with crystalloids for ﬂuid resuscitation in critically ill nonpregnant patients (patients with burns trauma or following surgery). This reviewconcluded that resuscitation with colloids was not associated with an improvement in survival and thatthe use of one particular colloid hydroxyethyl starch might increase mortality.Evidence level 1++ 5.3.4 Blood transfusion There are no ﬁrm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion. The decision to provide blood transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment. /check The use of blood and blood products in obstetric practice is addressed in the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47.13There are no ﬁrm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion75 76and the decision to provide blood transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment. While bloodtransfusion is almost always required when the Hb is less than 60 g/l and rarely required when the Hbis more than 100 g/l patients with acute haemorrhage can have normal Hb and clinical evaluation in thissituation is therefore extremely important. Between 2009 and 2012 3there were at least three maternal deaths where an acute point of care Hb measurement result is thought to have falsely reassured staff. Furthermore the Serious Hazards of Transfusion reporting scheme has highlighted therisk of errors in using near patient testing of Hb measurements to guide transfusion. 77While single Hb/ haematocrit estimations may be misleading and can lead to delays in initiating red cell transfusion serialmeasurements may be helpful to monitor ongoing progress. Guidelines from the European Society ofAnaesthesiology 78recommend that repeated measurements of serum lactate and base deﬁcit together with haematocrit/Hb are made during haemorrhage and resuscitation to assess tissue perfusion and oxygenation;however it has not yet been shown whether the outcome of severe bleeding can be improved if volumeresuscitation is guided by serum lactate concentration and base deﬁcit.Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e122 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Major obstetric haemorrhage protocols must include the provision of emergency blood with immediate issue of group O rhesus D (RhD)-negative and K-negative units with a switch togroup-speci ﬁc blood as soon as feasible.D If clinically signi ﬁcant red cell antibodies are present close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is essential to avoid delay in transfusion in life-threatening haemorrhage.D All delivery units especially small units without a blood bank on site should maintain a supplyof group O RhD-negative blood./check Intraoperative cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in PPH associated withcaesarean section and with vaginal delivery.D Pregnant women (and women of childbearing age) who are RhD negative must only receive RhD-negative blood to avoid the risk of D alloimmunisation.79Previous blood transfusion is an important cause of alloimmunisation with antibodies other than anti-D in particular anti-K causing severe haemolytic diseaseof the fetus and newborn . 80Accordingly unless a woman is known to be K positive only K-negative blood should be used for transfusion in women of childbearing age.79The aim of antibody screening is to determine the presence of red cell antibodies of likely clinical signiﬁcance. In addition to the risk ofhaemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn 80these red cell antibodies may have implications for the selection of blood for transfusion in the mother owing to the risk of haemolytic transfusion reactions andthe laboratory should select red cell units negative for the relevant antigen for cross-matching. Closeliaison with the transfusion laboratory is essential with input if needed from the clinical haematology teamand specialist advice from the national blood service.Evidence level 4 All delivery units especially small units without a blood bank on site should maintain a supply of group O RhD- negative blood as this might offer the only means of restoring oxygen-carrying capacity within an acceptabletimescale. The minimum number of units of group O RhD-negative K-negative blood to be maintained on siteshould be agreed within local protocols and should reﬂect the likely period of delay in the arrival of further suppliesshould an emergency arise; small delivery units remote from the nearest blood bank will require a larger minimumsupply than those a short distance from a blood bank. Cross-matching versus electronic issue of blood The principles of blood grouping antibody testing and selection of blood in pregnancy are addressed in the RCOGGreen-top Guideline No. 47. 13 The majority of laboratories in the UK now use automated testing for blood grouping and antibody testingwith advanced information technology systems for documentation and reporting of results. The hospitaltransfusion laboratory can readily provide red cells that are ABO and RhD compatible using electronic issue with no cross-matching needed provided that the patient does not have any antibodies and there are robust automated systems in place for antibody testing and identiﬁcation of the patient. 79In this setting since blood can be readily issued there is no need to reserve units for individual cases. Where electronic issue is notavailable a locally agreed maximum surgical blood ordering schedule should be used to decide how many redcell units should be reserved and available for particular cases based on the obstetric diagnosis. In unforeseenhaemorrhage group O RhD-negative and K-negative units must be immediately available for emergency use with a switch to group-speciﬁc blood as soon as feasible.Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e123 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Cell salvage does not appear to impact adversely onclinical outcomes. 83 84Several bodies have endorsed cell salvage in obstetric practice including NICE 85 the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE)10and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.86It has been proposed that cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in PPH associated with both caesarean section and vaginal delivery.87Although large prospective trials of cell salvage with autotransfusion in obstetrics are lacking to date no single serious complicationleading to poor maternal outcome has been directly attributed to its use. A large RCT is currently inprogress comparing intraoperative cell salvage with donor blood transfusions (standard care) duringcaesarean section in women at risk of haemorrhage (SALVO study UKCRN ID14032). 88Evidence level 4 5.3.5 Blood components There are limited data to inform best clinical practice for the management of haemostatic impairment during PPH but the principle of management is to prevent and treat haemostatic abnormalities during bleeding but not tocorrect abnormalities in nonbleeding women. It is not known whether haemostasis should be corrected to normalityfor pregnant or nonpregnant women. Methods to assess haemostatic impairment during PPH include clinical observation laboratory-based tests (PT APTT Clauss ﬁbrinogen and platelet count) and point of care testing. 89Studies in patients following surgery show that laboratory or point of care testing leads to appropriate use of blood components90and both may be used simultaneously. Coagulopathies may evolve rapidly and repeated testing (such as every30 minutes) during continued bleeding and observation of trends are more useful than single measurements. Evidence level 3Routine coagulation tests are widely available and have well-regulated quality control.89 91They include PT APTT Clauss ﬁbrinogen assay and platelet count. However turnaround times are often too slow to beclinically useful in acute and rapidly evolving bleeds and inevitably reﬂect the past haemostatic status of thewoman. Clauss ﬁbrinogen should always be measured as part of the routine coagulation screen because itfalls early and may be reduced to a clinically signiﬁcant level despite a normal PT/APTT. 89 91 92Platelet number should be measured as part of the full blood count.

Point of care testing using TEG/C226and ROTEM/C226has been recommended by the Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association/Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.95However NICE has concluded that there is insufﬁcient evidence to recommend the routine adoption ofviscoelastometric point of care testing in the management of PPH. 96If used a quality control protocol should be agreed with the haematology laboratory.Evidence level 4 Transfusion of FFP If no haemostatic results are available and bleeding is continuing then after 4 units of RBCs FFP should be infused at a dose of 12 –15 ml/kg until haemostatic test results are known.D If no haemostatic tests are available early FFP should be considered for conditions with a suspected coagulopathy such as placental abruption or amniotic ﬂuid embolism or where detection of PPH has been delayed./check If PT/APTT is more than 1.5 times normal and haemorrhage is ongoing volumes of FFP inexcess of 15 ml/kg are likely to be needed to correct coagulopathy.D Clinicians should be aware that these blood components must be ordered as soon as a needfor them is anticipated as there will always be a short delay in supply because of the need forthawing./check Formulaic protocols such as 1:1 or 6:4 RBC:FFP based on data derived from traumatic bleeding have been advocated for the management of major haemorrhage.69 71However there is no evidence that this improves outcomes in PPH. The drawbacks of early FFP are that the majority of women with PPH willhave normal coagulation at the time of administration 97–99and that it is associated with an increased risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)100and transfusion-related acute lung injury.101FFP results in relatively small increments in ﬁbrinogen level and to increase the level rapidly cryoprecipitate orﬁbrinogen concentrate are required. 102 There are limited data on the utility of laboratory and point of care coagulation tests to guide FFPreplacement during PPH. Abnormal PT/APTT suggests progression towards signiﬁcant haemostaticimpairment while PT/APTT greater than 1.5 times normal demonstrate that severe and establishedhaemostatic impairment has occurred. 67 68 103 If the PPH has stopped no FFP is required. If haemorrhage is ongoing and the last PT/APTT results areavailable and are prolonged 12 –15 ml/kg of FFP should be requested and infused with the aim of maintaining the PT/APTT at less than 1.5 times normal. 68If the PT/APTT is greater than 1.5 times normal a larger volume of FFP is likely to be required to correct these parameters 104and this may be associated with an increased risk of TACO. If the PT/APTT are normal then no FFP is required although repeatedtesting should be performed if bleeding persists.Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e125 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Such empirical use of FFP is in line with publishedguidance. 67 68 71 105FFP transfusion earlier than this could be considered for placental abruption or amniotic ﬂuid embolism because these situations are associated with early coagulopathy106 107or if diagnosis of PPH has been delayed.Evidence level 4 In rare cases of massive bleeding where women have been given 8 or more units of RBCs and they continue to bleed and still no coagulation results or platelet counts are available then 2 pools ofcryoprecipitate and 1 pool of platelets should be infused. 108Evidence level 3 Fibrinogen A plasma ﬁbrinogen level of greater than 2 g/l should be maintained during ongoing PPH.C Cryoprecipitate should be used for ﬁbrinogen replacement.D Observational studies show that a ﬁbrinogen level of 1.0 –1.5 g/l is likely to be too low for adequate haemostasis during ongoing PPH.97 98 109 –111Fibrinogen below 3 g/l and especially below 2 g/l is associated with progression of bleeding increased RBC and blood component requirements and the need forinvasive procedures. 109Evidence level 2+ A double-blind RCT112has shown that pre-emptive infusion of 2 g ﬁbrinogen concentrate in women with 500–1000 ml PPH has no beneﬁt; however the ﬁbrinogen level at the time of randomisation was greater than 4 g/l in most women.Evidence level 1 The appropriate ﬁbrinogen intervention trigger or target level is unknown. A pragmatic view based on available evidence is that during continuing PPH cryoprecipitate or ﬁbrinogen concentrate should be used to maintain aﬁbrinogen level of at least 2 g/l even if PT/APTT are normal. Fibrinogen loss can be replaced by cryoprecipitateor ﬁbrinogen concentrate although ﬁbrinogen concentrate is not licensed for acquired hypoﬁbrinogenaemia inthe UK. Similar clinical outcomes and increments in ﬁbrinogen have been reported for cryoprecipitate andﬁbrinogen concentrate but these are based on limited data. 113It is expected that 2 pools of cryoprecipitate (1 pool is taken from ﬁve donors) would increase the ﬁbrinogen level by about 1 g/l. Increasing the ﬁbrinogenlevel by 1 g/l requires about 60 mg/kg ﬁbrinogen concentrate. 114Observational studies report improved clinical haemostasis and possible reduced use of FFP and post-transfusion-related events such as TACO 94 115 associated with infusion of ﬁbrinogen but RCTs are required.93 113 114 116 117Evidence level 3 Transfusion of platelets During PPH platelets should be transfused when the platelet count is less than 75 3109/l based on laboratory monitoring.D There is general consensus that platelets should be transfused at a trigger of 75 9109/l to maintain a level greater than 50 9109/l during ongoing PPH.68 71Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e126 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Consideration should be given to the use of tranexamic acid in the management of PPH.B A large RCT118found that early administration of tranexamic acid in the management of trauma in nonpregnant patients resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in death from haemorrhage. The dose employed inthis study was 1 g intravenously over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 hours. One RCT 119 assessed the role of high-dose tranexamic acid in PPH. Women with PPH greater than 800 ml followingvaginal delivery were randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (loading dose 4 g over 1 hour theninfusion of 1 g/hour over 6 hours) or not; the study concluded that high-dose tranexamic acid can reduceblood loss fall in Hb and the need for blood transfusion. The study was not powered to address safetyissues and speciﬁcally the risk of the treatment causing deep vein thrombosis. A Cochrane review 2on treatments for PPH found that trials testing the effectiveness of tranexamic acid were too small to draw meaningful conclusions. A large trial120is currently in progress aiming to determine the effect of early administration of tranexamic acid on mortality hysterectomy and other morbidities in women with PPH. The dose of tranexamic acid employed in this trial is 1 g by intravenousinjection; a second dose may be given after 30 minutes.Evidence level 1+ 5.3.7 Is there a role for recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) therapy? The routine use of rFVIIa is not recommended in the management of major PPH unless as part of a clinical trial. /check rFVIIa (NovoSeven/C226 Novo Nordisk Bagsværd Denmark) is an expensive product that is licensed in the UK for the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with speciﬁc inherited bleeding disorders. Outwithits licence it has been used primarily in the management of uncontrolled haemorrhage in the traumasetting. It reduces blood loss through enhancement of tissue factor-dependent coagulation. Its effectivenessis markedly diminished by hypothermia acidosis and low platelets so effective resuscitation towardsnormal physiology is a prerequisite of its use. 121Evidence level 3 There are only poor quality data from anecdotal reports or patient registries to support its use.122 Systematic reviews of case series and observational studies have examined the use of rFVIIa in PPH.123 124 In a review of the literature regarding the use of rFVIIa in the treatment of PPH Ahonen122concluded that rFVIIa should not be used to compensate for inadequate blood transfusion therapy; administration of bloodand blood products as well as management of uterine atony are essential in the treatment of PPH beforeconsidering administration of rFVIIa. A 2015 open-label RCT 125(n=84) found that administration of rFVIIa lowered the risk of requiring second-line therapies by 44% (RR 0.56 95% CI 0.42 –0.76) compared with controls (no rFVIIa) in women with PPH in whom uterotonics had failed to arrest the bleeding.All 84 women survived but two women in the intervention group experienced a venousthromboembolism (2/42). A study 126investigating the safety of rFVIIa when employed on an off-label basis to treat life-threatening haemorrhage found a signiﬁcant increase in the risk of arterial but not venous thromboembolic events whencompared with placebo (5.5% versus 3.2%).Evidence level 1+ RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e127 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Full protocol for monitoring and investigation in major PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml) and ongoing haemorrhage or clinical shock:D /C15immediate venepuncture (20 ml) for: –cross-match (4 units minimum) –full blood count –coagulation screen including ﬁbrinogen –renal and liver function for baseline /C15monitor temperature every 15 minutes /C15continuous pulse blood pressure recording and respiratory rate (using oximeter electrocardiogram and automated blood pressure recording) /C15Foley catheter to monitor urine output /C15two peripheral cannulae 14 gauge /C15consider arterial line monitoring (once appropriately experienced staff available for insertion) /C15consider transfer to intensive therapy unit once the bleeding is controlled or monitoring at highdependency unit on delivery suite if appropriate /C15recording of parameters on a modi ﬁed early obstetric warning score (MEOWS) chart (see Appendix IV) /C15acting and escalating promptly when abnormal scores from a MEOWS chart are observed /C15documentation of ﬂuid balance blood blood products and procedures. Continuous physiological monitoring is necessary and the recording of parameters over time on a ﬂow chart that will give the reader good visual cues on the clinical progress of the patient (Appendix IV). The need to continuallyre-evaluate the woman’s physiological condition even when bleeding appears to have stopped is essential torecognise continuing bleeding. The presence of a central line not only provides a means of accurate central venous pressure monitoring but also a route for rapid ﬂuid replacement. Nevertheless the threshold for instituting invasive monitoringhas been controversial with some authorities advising early recourse to central venous pressuremonitoring 127–129and others advocating caution.76 130The 2000 –02 report of the UK Conﬁdential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths (CEMD)29included the recommendation: ‘Central venous and direct arterial pressure monitoring should be used when the cardiovascular system is compromised byhaemorrhage or disease’. Central venous pressure monitoring requires early involvement of a seniorskilled anaesthetist who will usually take responsibility for this aspect of management. The use ofultrasound is more likely to make the procedure safer 29as this procedure carries signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality.131Once bleeding is under control transfer to an intensive care or high dependency unit on delivery suite should be considered depending on the severity of the blood loss (see section 5.6.3).Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e128 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Alternatively anti-embolismstockings foot impulse devices or intermittent pneumatic compression devices can be used if chemicalthromboprophylaxis is contraindicated for example in cases of thrombocytopenia. 132Evidence level 4 5.5 What is the role of the anaesthetist in the management of PPH? The management of PPH requires a multidisciplinary approach: the anaesthetist plays a crucial role in maintaining haemodynamic stability and if necessary in determining and administeringthe most appropriate method of anaesthesia.D Anaesthetists play an important role in the multidisciplinary team involved in the management of patients with PPH. A senior anaesthetist should be consulted early to help assess initiate and continue promptresuscitation of these patients using their expertise in ﬂuid and transfusion therapy as well as theirexperience in managing critically ill patients. 10 If the patient needs to go to theatre for a surgical intervention an experienced anaesthetist shouldpromptly assess the patient in order to decide on the most suitable mode of anaesthesia depending onthe patient’s haemodynamic status. Central neuraxial anaesthesia has become the anaesthetic technique ofchoice in the obstetric population and this has resulted in a reduction in maternal mortality. 133 While general anaesthesia in obstetric patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality whencompared with regional anaesthesia due to the physiological changes that occur in pregnancy 9it may be preferable in patients who are haemodynamically unstable or who have a coagulopathy. The patient may need high dependency or intensive care in the postoperative period. An obstetric early warning score system would help in the early identiﬁcation of continuous bleeding especially in caseswhich are not apparent as recommended by CMACE (see Appendix IV). 131Evidence level 4 5.6 What methods should be employed to arrest the bleeding? Clinicians should be prepared to use a combination of pharmacological mechanical and surgical methods to arrest PPH. These methods should be directed towards the causative factor.D Careful clinical examination is required to determine the cause of PPH (see Table 1 and Appendix II for the risk factors and causes of PPH). A 2014 Cochrane review2addressing the treatment of primary PPH found no trials evaluating surgical techniques or radiological interventions for women with primary PPHthat were unresponsive to pharmacological methods. Thus recommendations on treatment strategies arebased on observational data and consensus only.Evidence level 4 5.6.1 What pharmacological and mechanical strategies can be used? When uterine atony is perceived to be a cause of the bleeding then a sequence of mechanical and pharmacological measures should be instituted in turn until the bleeding stops. /check RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e129 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License ###25###The most common cause of primary PPH is uterine atony.27The initial management of PPH should therefore involve measures to stimulate myometrial contractions. The following mechanical and pharmacological measures should be instituted/administered in turn:2 /C15palpate the uterine fundus and rub it to stimulate contractions (‘rubbing up the fundus’) /C15ensure that the bladder is empty (Foley catheter leave in place) /C15oxytocin 5 iu by slow intravenous injection (may have repeat dose) /C15ergometrine 0.5 mg by slow intravenous or intramuscular injection (contraindicated in women with hypertension) /C15oxytocin infusion (40 iu in 500 ml isotonic crystalloids at 125 ml/hour) unless ﬂuid restriction is necessary /C15carboprost 0.25 mg by intramuscular injection repeated at intervals of not less than 15 minutesto a maximum of eight doses (use with caution in women with asthma) /C15misoprostol 800 micrograms sublingually. The simple mechanical and physiological measures of ‘rubbing up the fundus’ and emptying the bladder to stimulate uterine contraction represent ﬁrst-line management of PPH. No published studies have beenidentiﬁed to provide an evidence base for these interventions; nevertheless professional consensussupports their continued use. 134 Despite decades of empirical use in clinical practice there are no trials comparing ergometrine withoxytocin as ﬁrst-line agents for the treatment of PPH. It seems appropriate to use both agents althoughoxytocin is to be preferred initially especially in women with hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Previousguidance 1advocated an initial dose of 10 iu oxytocin by slow intravenous injection for treatment (rather than prophylaxis) of PPH. The British National Formulary recommends a dose of 5 iu ‘by slowintravenous injection (dose may be repeated)’. 135The 1997 –99 report of the UK CEMD highlighted the risk of profound hypotension that may be associated with oxytocin injection.136This guideline has adopted the CEMD recommendation that ‘When given as an intravenous bolus the drug should be givenslowly in a dose of not more than 5 iu’. This dosage is in line with guidance from other authorities. 30 135Evidence level 4 There are no trials comparing the prostaglandin carboprost (15-methyl prostaglandin F 2a) with other uterotonic agents. Two case series from the USA 137 138comprising 26 and 237 cases respectively have reported on the use of carboprost in the successful management of PPH without resort to surgicalinterventions in 85% and 95% of cases. Two of the four failures in the smaller series were associated withplacenta accreta. If bleeding occurs at the time of caesarean section intramyometrial injection ofcarboprost may be used (although not licensed). It is also possible to inject intramyometrial carboprostthrough the abdominal wall in the absence of laparotomy. The recommended dose is 250 microgramsintramuscularly. This may be repeated every 15 minutes to a total dose of 2 mg (eight doses). However ifsigniﬁcant atonic haemorrhage continues after a third dose of carboprost without signiﬁcant improvement(i.e. 30 minutes or more after the ﬁrst dose was given) the team should consider transfer to theoperating theatre for examination under anaesthesia with an awareness of the impending need forlaparotomy and/or hysterectomy.

Compared with 40 iu oxytocin infusion 800 micrograms sublingual misoprostol was associated with a signiﬁcant increase in the number of womenwho had blood loss of at least 1000 ml (RR 2.65 95% CI 1.04 –6.75) and who required blood transfusion (RR 1.47 95% CI 1.02 –2.14). The review authors concluded that oxytocin infusion should be recommended as ﬁrst-line treatment for primary PPH. When used following prophylactic uterotonics misoprostol and oxytocin infusion work similarly.Evidence level 1+ A study140of women in early pregnancy demonstrated that regardless of the route of administration (vaginal sublingual or rectal) misoprostol took 1.0 –2.5 hours to increase uterine tone. Clinicians should be aware of this delay in the clinical effect of misoprostol. Guidelines from WHO141and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics142recommend that in the management of PPH misoprostol is administered sublingually.Evidence level 4 5.6.2 What surgical treatments can be employed to arrest the bleeding? If pharmacological measures fail to control the haemorrhage surgical interventions should be initiated sooner rather than later.D Intrauterine balloon tamponade is an appropriate ﬁrst-line ‘surgical ’intervention for most women where uterine atony is the only or main cause of haemorrhage.C Conservative surgical interventions may be attempted as second line depending on clinicalcircumstances and available expertise.C It is recommended that a laminated diagram of the brace suture technique be kept in theatre./check Resort to hysterectomy sooner rather than later (especially in cases of placenta accreta oruterine rupture) .C Ideally and when feasible a second experienced clinician should be involved in the decision for hysterectomy. /check The use of pharmacological agents other than those detailed should not delay recourse to surgery. Once the decision is made to embark on surgical haemostasis the most appropriate choice of procedure will depend in part on the experience and expertise of available staff. Compression of the aorta may be a temporary but effective measure to allow time for resuscitation to catch up with the volume replacement and the appropriate surgical support to arrive. The judgement of senior clinicians takinginto account the individual woman’s future reproductive aspirations is required in deciding the appropriate sequenceof interventions. The management of placenta praevia accreta is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and guidance is available in the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 27. 12 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e131 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

A ‘positive test’ (control of PPH following inﬂation of the balloon) indicates that laparotomy is not required whereas a ‘negative test’ (continued PPH following inﬂation of the balloon) is an indication to proceed tolaparotomy. The concept of balloon tamponade as a ‘test’ serves to afﬁrm its place as ﬁrst-line ‘surgical’ management. There is no clear evidence on how long the balloon tamponade should be left in place. In most cases 4 –6 hours of tamponade should be adequate to achieve haemostasis and ideally it should be removed during daytime hours in the presence of appropriate senior staff in case further intervention isnecessary. 146 147Evidence level 4 A systematic review concluded that uterine balloon tamponade is an effective treatment for PPH in resource-poor settings.152Evidence level 2++ 5.6.2.2 Haemostatic suturing Several case series153have been published describing success with haemostatic brace sutures. The best known version described by B-Lynch in 1997 154requires hysterotomy for its insertion and is particularly suitable when the uterus has already been opened for a caesarean section. A review published in 2005155 summarised nine case series of B-Lynch suturing (a total of 32 cases) reporting success in all but one case. In 2002 Hayman et al.156described a modiﬁed compression suture which does not require hysterotomy and success in 10/11 women managed with this suture has been reported.157Other authors have described variants on these techniques.158 159Double vertical compression sutures have proved effective in treating PPH due to atony and placenta praevia. This may have a dual action of reducing uterine bloodﬂow and compressing the bleeding surface. 160 A prospective population-based study of 211 women treated with a uterine compression suture to controlPPH concluded that the overall failure rate of sutures leading to hysterectomy was 25%. 161There was no difference in failure rate among B-Lynch modiﬁed B-Lynch and other suture techniques. Risk factors for ahysterectomy included increasing age and vaginal delivery. In addition a prolonged delay of 2 –6 hours between delivery and uterine compression suture was independently associated with a four-fold increasedrisk of hysterectomy. This emphasises the need for careful postpartum evaluation of blood loss to avoidprolonged delay in haemorrhage recognition.Evidence level 3 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e132 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

Again this success rate is of the same order as thatreported in other case series. Evidence level 3 These observational data suggest that haemostatic suture techniques are effective in controlling severe PPH and in reducing the need for hysterectomy. In the absence of comparative data to demonstrate that any one variant is superior to another obstetricians are encouraged to familiarise themselves with one technique under the supervision of an experienced colleague. It is recommended that a laminated diagram of the brace suture techniquebe kept in theatre. A systematic review 162has concluded that compression sutures are associated with a low complication rate. A higher risk of uterine ischaemia appeared to be caused when the procedure was combined withvessel ligation. No negative impact on fertility has been reported. Case series have reported the combined use of haemostatic suturing and balloon tamponade in the management of PPH. 163–165Evidence level 3 5.6.2.3 Stepwise uterine devascularisation and internal iliac artery ligation Stepwise uterine devascularisation describes the successive ligation of (i) one uterine artery (ii) both uterine arteries (iii) low uterine arteries (iv) one ovarian artery and (v) both ovarian arteries in the management of PPH.166The original case series167of 103 patients with intractable PPH not responding to medical management was effective in all cases without the need for hysterectomy leading some cliniciansto propose that stepwise uterine devascularisation should be the ﬁrst-line conservative surgical treatmentto control PPH. When internal iliac artery ligation is being considered a senior gynaecologist or vascular surgeon should be informed and involved since this technique requires a high degree of surgical skill and training and may beassociated with ureteric injury. A case series described 84 women with PPH from various causes whounderwent internal iliac artery ligation as the ﬁrst-line surgical intervention. Hysterectomy wassubsequently required in 33 (39%) women. 168 A study of 45 women following internal iliac artery ligation suggests that subsequent fertility and pregnancyoutcomes are not impaired. 169Evidence level 3 A systematic review170of fertility outcomes following the surgical management of PPH concluded that uterine devascularisation techniques including internal iliac artery ligation did not adversely affect futurefertility although the number of studies and quality of evidence was limited.Evidence level 2++ RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e133 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

It was successful in arresting the bleeding in 86.5% (217/251). The analysis suggested that caesarean sectiondelivery disseminated intravascular coagulation and transfusion of more than 10 units of packed red cellswere related to failed embolisation. Evidence level 3 The logistics of performing arterial occlusion or embolisation where the equipment or an interventional radiologist may not be available mean that uterine balloon tamponade is a more appropriate ﬁrst-line treatment. Follow-up studies of 17172and 25173women who underwent arterial embolisation for treatment of PPH suggest that the intervention does not impair subsequent menstruation fertility and obstetric outcomes.Selective arterial occlusion may also be effective after failed internal iliac artery ligation. 174Evidence level 3 5.6.2.5 Hysterectomy The decision for hysterectomy should be made by an experienced consultant clinician and the decision preferably discussed with a second experienced clinician when feasible.29Early recourse to hysterectomy is recommended especially where bleeding is associated with placenta accreta or uterine rupture.12 Hysterectomy should not be delayed until the woman is in extremis or while less deﬁnitive procedureswith which the surgeon has little experience are attempted. The procedure should be carried out by asurgeon who is experienced in carrying out hysterectomies. Subtotal hysterectomy is the operation ofchoice in many instances of PPH requiring hysterectomy unless there is trauma to the cervix or amorbidly adherent placenta in the lower segment.Evidence level 4 Sequential reports of the Scottish Conﬁdential Audit of Severe Maternal Morbidity from 2003 until 2012 summarised in the ﬁnal 2014 publication 150have shown a statistically signiﬁcant fall in the proportion of women with PPH (with blood loss greater than or equal to 2500 ml) requiring a hysterectomy to controlthe bleeding and an increase in the use of conservative surgical techniques.Evidence level 3 5.6.3 Intensive and high dependency units and post-PPH care The 2006 –08 CMACE report10identiﬁed that three deaths were due to la ck of optimal care following PPH and in particular a lack of routine observation in the postpartum period. Sequential reports10 131have recommended the use of MEOWS charts to alert caregivers to abn ormal trends in haemodynamic measurements.Evidence level 4 A prospective audit175of the management of major PPH (deﬁned in the audit as blood loss of 2500 ml or more transfused 5 or more units of packed red cells or received treatment for coagulopathy) found thatthe majority of women received high dependency care on the labour ward while only 21% were admittedto intensive care. The authors concluded that care for these women may be better provided byobstetricians and anaesthetists on the labour ward a view that others have shared. 176Evidence level 3 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e134 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

How should secondary PPH be managed? In women presenting with secondary PPH an assessment of vaginal microbiology should be performed (high vaginal and endocervical swabs) and appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy should be initiated when endometritis is suspected.D A pelvic ultrasound may help to exclude the presence of retained products of conception(RPOC) although the diagnosis of retained products is unreliable.C Surgical evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by anexperienced clinician.D The causes of secondary PPH are numerous and include endometritis RPOC and subinvolution of the placental implantation site.177 178The management of women presenting with secondary PPH should include an assessment of their haemodynamic status an assessment of the blood loss and an evaluation ofthe woman’s concerns (for example is her bleeding becoming inconvenient because it has persisted longerthan she had expected?).Evidence level 4 Investigations should include bacteriological testing for endometritis (high vaginal swab) although a low yield of positive vaginal swab results has been reported in patients with secondary PPH.179In contrast Pather et al.180found a high incidence of abnormal vaginal microbiology (52%) and endometritis in their case series supporting the practice of routine assessment of vaginal microbiology and appropriate use ofantimicrobial therapy in women presenting with secondary PPH.Evidence level 3 A Cochrane review investigated the effect of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of postpartum endometritis.181This review concluded that a combination of clindamycin and gentamicin is appropriate and that once uncomplicated endometritis has clinically improved with intravenous therapy there is noadditional beneﬁt from further oral therapy. The management of women presenting with secondary PPHand sepsis is addressed in the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 64b. 182Evidence level 1 /C0 Pelvic ultrasound scans are commonly performed on women presenting with secondary PPH to identify any RPOC. Case series180 183 –186have reported a wide range of sensitivities and speciﬁcities of ultrasound in the detection of RPOC (44 –94% and 16 –92% respectively). These series suggest that the presence of an echogenic mass and a thickened ‘endometrium’ is associated with RPOC. In a prospective observationalstudy 187of 79 women with secondary PPH Mulic-Lutvica and Axelsson concluded that an echogenic mass in the uterine cavity and an anteroposterior diameter of the cavity above the 90th centile (approximately25 mm on days 1 –7 postpartum) was associated with RPOC. Since the range of sensitivities and speciﬁcities of ultrasound in the detection of RPOC is so wide the clinical ﬁndings including the degree ofbleeding and whether the cervical os is open should be taken into account before the decision toundertake surgery is made. It has been proposed that colour ﬂow Doppler imaging should be included inthe evaluation of the postpartum uterus although there is no strong evidence to support its use; 178its use may facilitate the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous malformations which are rare butrecognised causes of secondary PPH. 188–190Evidence level 3 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e135 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

A 2002 Cochrane review (assessed as up-to-date in January 2008) addressed treatments for secondary PPH. 4No trials were identiﬁed which met the review group’s inclusion criteria and no recommendations were made regarding effective treatments. Uterotonics such as misoprostol and ergometrine have beenrecommended in the management of secondary PPH although evidence to support their use islimited. 178Transcatheter arterial embolisation193and balloon tamponade194have been employed in cases of secondary PPH with ongoing bleeding.Evidence level 3 7. Risk management 7.1 Training and preparation: what measures can be taken to ensure optimal management of PPH? Every maternity unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol for the management of PPH./check All staff involved in maternity care should receive training in the management of obstetric emergencies including the management of PPH.B Training for PPH should be multiprofessional and include team rehearsals.B All cases of PPH involving a blood loss of greater than 1500 ml should be the subject of aformal clinical incident review.D To ensure optimal management of PPH every unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol with which staff should be familiar (see section 5). Updates on the management of obstetric emergencies(including the management of PPH) are a proactive approach to risk management. Skills drills shouldensure that all members of staff including those working in the transfusion laboratory are aware oftheir role in the management of PPH. A systematic review 195of the effectiveness of multidisciplinary simulation training in obstetric emergencies (including PPH) showed that teamwork training in asimulation setting resulted in improvement of knowledge practical skills communication and teamperformance. Training in a simulation centre did not further improve outcome compared with trainingat a local unit.Evidence level 2++ The RCOG recommends that all cases of PPH with an estimated blood loss of more than 1500 ml should be the subject of a formal clinical incident review.196Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e136 of e149 ª2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 14710528 2017 5 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

In addition inadequate documentation can contribute to the likelihood of there being medicolegal consequences.197The team member recording events on the structured proforma the scribe is crucial in the management of PPH (see Appendix V); the proforma is effectively a checklist of available interventions andteam leaders should communicate with the scribe during the PPH to ensure that no steps have been omitted.PPH should be notiﬁed through a clinical incident reporting or risk management system.Evidence level 4 It is important to record: /C15the staff in attendance and the time they arrived /C15the sequence of events /C15the administration of different pharmacological agents their timing and sequence /C15the time of surgical intervention where relevant /C15the condition of the mother throughout the different steps /C15the timing of the ﬂuid and blood products given. 7.3 Debrieﬁng An opportunity to discuss the events surrounding the obstetric haemorrhage should be offered to the woman (possibly with her birthing partner/s) at a mutually convenient time. /check After obstetric emergencies women can be psychologically affected by postnatal depression or fear of further childbirth. Major PPH can be traumatic to women and their families and has been associated withthe subsequent development of post-traumatic stress disorder. 198Women who have experienced a major PPH should be offered an opportunity to discuss the events surrounding their delivery. A discussion offuture pregnancy including the likelihood of a repeat PPH and any fears regarding pregnancy andchildbirth that the woman may have should be addressed. This should include arrangements forappropriate investigations as necessary such as testing for coagulopathies if there are other indicators andscreening for the rare complication of postpartum hypopituitarism (Sheehan syndrome) secondary tohypotension. 199Evidence level 4 8. Recommendations for future research /C15RCTs are required to identify the best drug combinations route and dose of uterotonics for the treatment of primary PPH. /C15The role of viscoelastometric point of care tests using TEG/C226and ROTEM/C226in the management of PPH requires evaluation. /C15Studies are required to determine the optimal ratio of packed red cells to FFP in the management ofobstetric haemorrhage.

Each guideline is systematically developed using a standardised methodology. Exact details of this process can be found in Clinical Governance Advice No. 1 Development of RCOG Green-top Guidelines (available on the RCOG website at www.rcog.org.uk/green-top-development ). These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must beevaluated with reference to individual patient needs resources and limitations unique to the institution and variationsin local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines intoroutine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated. The evidence used in this guideline was graded using the scheme below and the recommendations formulated in a similar fashion with a standardised grading scheme.

Methods—‘PubMed’ ‘EMBASE’ ‘CENTRAL’ and ‘CINAHL’ electronic databases were searched for clinical trials analyzing the effectiveness of different dose of oxytocin given intravenously during surgery for uterine contraction and to reduce postpartum hemorrhage. A systematic review of relevant literature sources was performed. Results—our search revealed 813 literature sources. A total of 15 randomized clinical trials comparing different doses of oxytocin bolus and infusion used after caesarean delivery have met the selection criteria. Conclusion—oxytocin bolus 0.5–3 UI is considered an effective prophylactic dose. Recommended effective prophylactic oxytocin infusion dose is 7.72 IU/h but it is unanswered whether we really need a prophylactic infusion of oxytocin if we choose effective bolus dose size and rate. Adverse hemodynamic effects were observed when a 5 UI oxytocin bolus was used. However topics such as bolus dose size infusion dose size and requirement as well as bolus injection rate still remain unanswered. The doses that are recommended in the guidelines of peripartum hemorrhage prophy- laxis are not conﬁrmed by randomized controlled double-blind trials and more research should cover this topic. Keywords: oxytocin; uterine contraction; caesarean delivery; hemorrhage 1. Introduction Early postpartum hemorrhage can occur if oxytocin is not used or if the dose of its bolus or infusion is too small. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist deﬁnes early (primary) postpartum hemorrhage as at 1000 mL or more of total blood loss or loss of blood accompanied by signs and symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 h following the delivery including intrapartum loss [ 1]. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists divides it into minor (500–1000 mL) and major (1000 mL and more) categories. They also deﬁne late (secondary) postpartum hemorrhage as abnormal or excessive bleeding later than 24 h post-birth but no later than 12 weeks [ 2]. Parturient hemorrhage has been the main cause of maternal morbidity and mortality for many years all over the world. Postpartum hemorrhage is one of the most common complications after caesarean delivery which is an important surgical intervention performed in obstetric practice. This has to be considered because caesarean delivery rates in the developing world countries keep getting higher [ 3 4]. Minimizing the amount of blood lost during caesarean delivery has a great beneﬁt to decrease postoperative morbidity and to decrease the risks associated with blood transfusions. The routine use of oxytocin correlates with a signiﬁcant reduction in the occurrence of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) [5–7]. Finding an optimal dose of oxytocin in patients undergoing caesarean delivery is a problem of great importance because it is mandatory to achieve an adequate balance be- Int. J. Environ. Res.

Study Selection Process The research yielded 813 results extracted from one database. All duplicates were removed 526 articles were checked manually for relevance by screening their titles and abstracts. A total 120 results met the inclusion criteria but only 15 were included after a full-text review. Only full-text articles were selected because the information given in the abstract was not sufﬁcient for the thorough analysis. The randomized trials conducted in 2008–2020 which compared different doses of oxytocin or oxytocin and placebo given for patients during CD in order to investigate the effect of the drug on PPH and uterine contraction were analyzed. A total of 105 publications were excluded for reasons explained in Picture 1. 3.2. Characteristics of Included Studies Those 15 selected trials could be divided into several groups: those that investigate different bolus dose (5 trials) those that investigate different infusion dose (9 trials) and those that investigate both (1 trial). A summary of the results of 15 analyzed studies is provided in Table 1. 3.3. Synthesis of Results All 15 trials (bolus/infusion/both) included in this systematic review were investi- gated and compared in 4 categories: PPH and blood loss uterine contraction and hemody- namics. The summarized results can be seen in Table 2. Butwick and colleagues compared 75 women divided into 5 groups to receive 0 0.5 1 3 or 5 IU oxytocin bolus intravenously diluted with 5 mL of 0.9% normal saline and administered over the time period of 15 s. Adequate uterine tonus was measured at 2 3 6 and 9 min. There were no signiﬁcant differences of adequate uterine tonus at 2 min between the groups. Sixty-six per cent of participants in the placebo group had adequate uterine tonus at 3 min and 100% of the parturient receiving 3 IU of oxytocin ( p= 0.04). This study results indicated that adequate uterine tonus for patients during caesarean delivery can be achieved using a small 0.5–3 IU bolus of oxytocin plus continuous infusion of 250 mL normal saline with 10 IU of oxytocin [8]. Sartain with co-authors studied data of 80 women who were given 2 IU or 5 IU oxytocin bolus over 5–10 s and oxytocin infusion of at rate 10 IU/h for 4 h (40 IU totally) after delivery. No difference was found in blood loss uterine tone or need for additional uterotonic drugs. Nonetheless heart rate was found higher mean arterial pressure was found smaller and frequency of nausea and antiemetic drugs were bigger in the 5 IU oxytocin bolus group [9]. Somjit and co-authors compared 5 IU and 10 IU oxytocin bolus infused over 15 s and followed by the infusion with 20 IU of oxytocin (2.5 IU/h) impact on uterine contraction. Fewer patients who received 10 IU oxytocin bolus needed additional uterotonic agents. Blood loss and the uterine tone did not differ signiﬁcantly. They concluded that 5 IU was non-inferior to 10 IU oxytocin [10]. King with co-authors investigated the impact of 5 IU oxytocin bolus injected over 30 s on women who have at least one risk factor for uterine atony. One hundred and forty-three participants were divided into 2 groups: one group received 5 IU oxytocin bolus followed by 40 IU in 500 mL and 20 IU in 1 L saline oxytocin infusions and the second were given placebo bolus. The number of women requiring an additional dose of uterotonic agents was similar in both groups. They found a signiﬁcant difference in uterine tone after delivery which was bigger in the group who received 5 IU oxytocin bolus ( p< 0.001). However this result was transient and disappeared after 5 min. Therefore this study revealed that there is no difference in PPH between women who receive oxytocin bolus and those who do not [11]. ###4###Int. J. Environ. Res.

J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021 18 5029 8 of 14 Jonsson with colleagues investigated 5 and 10 IU of oxytocin IV bolus injected over 1 min impact on electrocardiography. Further doses of uterotonic drugs were available upon request. They found a signiﬁcant difference in the occurrence of ST depressions associated with oxytocin administration. The conclusion was that 5 IU has less effect on changes in ECG [12]. Kovacheva and colleagues from Boston conducted a study where one group of 30 women received 3 IU oxytocin bolus (over 15 s) and 500 mL saline infusion and the other group of the same size were given placebo bolus and 30 IU oxytocin in 500 mL infusion. Both groups received additional oxytocin according to uterine tone assessed between 3 min and 12 min if necessary. Women who received oxytocin bolus also received less oxytocin overall to achieve adequate uterine tone. No differences in hemodynamic or blood loss occurred [13]. Cecilia and colleagues conducted a trial of 271 women randomized into 2 groups: the ﬁrst group received 10 IU of oxytocin in 500 mL of ﬂuids over 2–4 h while the second group was given 30 IU of oxytocin in 1500 mL of ﬂuids over 8–12 h. The atonic uterus was seen in 1 patient from the ﬁrst group and 7 women from the second group ( p= 0.03). Postoperative fall in blood pressure tachycardia and amount of blood loss during the operation and postoperative period and blood transfusions were similar between groups. The conclusion was that a low-dose oxytocin regimen is as effective as a high-dose oxytocin regimen in the prevention of PPH in the postoperative period after caesarean delivery [ 14]. Ghulmiyyah and colleagues randomly assigned 189 patients into 3 groups where women received 20 30 or 40 IU of oxytocin in 500 mL solution over 30 min. No signiﬁcant difference in the change of hemoglobin concentration was observed. This implies that 20 IU oxytocin diluted in 500 mL solution is an appropriate dose for the prevention of PPH [ 15]. Dufﬁeld with colleagues included 51 women: 24 patients received 10 IU of oxytocin in 1 L solution and 27 received 60 IU of oxytocin in 1 L solution. Additional bolus doses of 1 IU oxytocin were given after evaluating uterine contraction between 2 min and 20 min at 2 min intervals if requested. They did not observe any statistically signiﬁcant difference in excessive blood loss between groups concluding that both low and high infusion of oxytocin works in the same preventive regime [16]. Gungorduk and co-authors investigated 360 women who were given 5 IU of oxytocin bolus (over 5–10 s) and consecutive infusion with placebo and other 360 participants re- ceived 5 IU of oxytocin bolus and consecutive infusion of 30 IU of oxytocin. Mean estimated blood loss ( p< 0.001) greater than 1000 mL were signiﬁcantly less in the group of patients who were given 30 IU oxytocin infusion. More women in the placebo group required an additional uterotonic agent ( p< 0.001) and blood transfusion ( p= 0.03). This study revealed that 30 IU oxytocin infusion given after bolus lowers the blood loss after CD [17]. Kajendran with other researchers aimed to ﬁnd out the difference in blood loss between two groups of patients who were given 5 IU oxytocin bolus over 5–10 and 46 were given 20 IU oxytocin in 500 mL saline and the other half were given just 500 mL saline later. The blood loss in the group of 20 IU oxytocin infusion was signiﬁcantly less ( p= 0.046). Visual estimation of blood loss made by the surgeon ( p= 0.01) and anesthetist ( p= 0.03) was also signiﬁcantly higher in the placebo group [18]. McLeod studied hemodynamic differences between 2 groups of women: both groups were given 5 UI oxytocin bolus over 3 min and 39 patients received 30 UI oxytocin infusion or 35 women were given placebo infusion. There were no signiﬁcant differences between groups during the 4-h study period. An additional oxytocin infusion after the bolus does not have a signiﬁcant impact on patient hemodynamic [19]. Murphy with other scientists compared the blood loss of 110 women divided in the same 2 groups as McLeod did. They favored the group with oxytocin infusion be- cause the blood loss was lower PPH occurred rarely and almost none needed additional uterotonic agent [20]. Sheehan with co-authors conducted a study of 2058 women who received 5 IU bolus over 1 min but half of them were given 40 IU oxytocin infusion ant others were ###9###Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021 18 5029 9 of 14 given a placebo infusion. No difference was found in PPH between groups ( p= 0.86). There was a signiﬁcant difference in uterotonic agent need it was higher in the placebo group ( p< 0.001) [21]. Qian and others conducted a trial in 2018 to ﬁnd out the rate of oxytocin infusion. All 150 women received 1 IU bolus of oxytocin followed by an oxytocin infusion at 0 1 3 5 8 IU/h. They found a 95% effective dose to be 7.72 IU/h and that the total oxytocin dose administered after delivery could be decreased if an infusion of oxytocin is given [22]. 4. Discussion Prophylactic uterotonic agents can prevent PPH and are routinely recommended. A systematic Cochrane review on uterotonic agents which included 196 clinical trials (135 559 women) and was published in 2018 concluded that oxytocin is effective for preventing peripartum hemorrhage when compared with placebo or no treatment. Er- gometrine plus oxytocin combination misoprostol plus oxytocin combination and car- betocin may have some additional desirable effects compared with oxytocin but the combination of two drugs is associated with more frequent side effects [23]. The main concern related to this topic is that there is not one opinion on what dosage of the uterotonic drug should be administered to prevent uterine atony and PPH. Despite the fact that oxytocin is used in everyday obstetric practice it seems that it is used empirically. The guidelines present a wide variety of oxytocin bolus doses and different infusion dose and rate and are based on expert opinion mostly that means that recommendations are not strong. The current WHO recommendation published in 2018 for preventing PPH is 10 IU of intramuscular or intravenous oxytocin for the prevention of PPH for all births. That dose is not related to a high rate of side effects and it also can be divided into a smaller intravenous bolus and an infusion. A rapid intravenous bolus injection must be avoided. One of the important research priorities indicated by WHO is the identiﬁcation of the optimal regimen of intravenous oxytocin at caesarean section [24]. A study conducted in Canada in 2016–2017 showed that for both high- and low- risk CD participants doctors use 5 IU IV oxytocin bolus although the range differs from 3 to 10 IU. In addition to bolus they also use an infusion: 20 IU (range 20–40)/L for low-risk CD and 40 IU (range 20–60)/L for high-risk CD [ 25]. This study inspired the release of a newly updated guideline in Canada. However the same recommendation concerning CD remained as in the 2009 version stating that 100 g of carbetocin should be given as an IV bolus over 1 min instead of continuous oxytocin infusion [ 26] The. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also released updated recommendations for postpartum hemorrhage in 2017. But prevention of uterine atony was not discussed separately; the closest recommendation was 10 IU of oxytocin bolus IV [ 27]. NATA consensus statements on prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage were issued in 2019. They rec- ommended administering an adjusted 5–10 IU intravenous oxytocin dose as the preferred preventive treatment [ 28]. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in the United Kingdom released updated recommendations for the prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage in 2016. They recommend the same 5 IU oxytocin dose by slow IV injection [ 5]. Guidelines released in France in 2015 stated that for prevention of postpartum hemorrhage after CD should be used 5–10 IU of oxytocin dose injected slowly (at least one-minute) IV [29]. It is very important to remember the fact that oxytocin is used for uterine atony prophylactics for most obstetric patients as supplementation of endogenous oxytocin. Carvalho dose-ﬁnding study results revealed that bolus should be only 0.35 IU but it should be followed by oxytocin infusion [30]. Balki and co-authors compared 30 women who were given 0.5 IU/mL IV oxytocin after the delivery. If the patient did not respond adequately to the initial bolus of oxytocin the initial dose for the next patient was increased by 0.5 IU. All patients received 20 IU ###10###Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021 18 5029 10 of 14 oxytocin in 1 L saline. All patients who received 3.5 IU initial oxytocin dose showed adequate uterine response within 1–2 min. An important fact is that all parturients were given oxytocin before CD for a minimum of 2 h so the sensitivity of oxytocin receptors could be reduced. This study indicated that women undergoing CD for labor arrest require approximately 3 IU of oxytocin as a bolus to achieve adequate uterine contraction and continuous oxytocin infusion of 20 IU in 1 L saline after that [31]. These two studies revealed that an adequate dosage of oxytocin bolus can be as small as 3 IU or even less and an additional continuous infusion of oxytocin is needed. The previous oxytocin administration has no inﬂuence on the dose. A cross-sectional study carried out by Beiranvand et al. concluded that the minimum effective dose is 1 IU and in those in labor progress 1–1.5 IU both followed by 20 IU oxytocin in 1000 mL infusion [ 32]. The previously mentioned up-down sequential method study of Carvalho also resulted in a small minimum effective dose. We analyzed 5 studies investigating superior bolus dose. The four trials comparing constant continuous infusion of oxytocin and different bolus doses [ 10–13] two of them had the placebo group [ 10 13] found that smaller bolus dose or even no bolus dose has the same effect as the bigger one. Sartain concluded that 2 IU is superior to 5 IU espe- cially if hemodynamics was analyzed [ 11]. In the study of Butwick more than a half of patients in the placebo group didn’t require a bolus dose [ 10] which is also conﬁrmed by King his study revealed that there is no difference in PPH between women who receive oxytocin bolus and those who do not [ 13]. Jonsson conducted a trial without continuous infusion and also concluded that a smaller dose has lower incidence of cardiovascular side effects [ 14]. The cardiovascular effect of oxytocin is very important. It is detected that 10 IU oxytocin bolus may cause temporary hypotension and tachycardia as well as myocardial ischemia [ 33]. Therefore when comparing the cardiovascular system response to oxytocin dosage a lower strategic tactic should be approached. Both Cecilia Ghulmiyyah and partly King investigated the effect of oxytocin infusion without bolus dose. All of them found that the bolus of oxytocin is not necessary to achieve adequate and wanted uterine contraction and prevent PPH and the smaller dose of oxytocin (10–20) given as continuous infusion has the same effect as the bigger one [ 13 16 17]. This should also be taken into the consideration as previously discussed cardiovascular changes are observed almost in every patient given at least 5 IU bolus of oxytocin so the strategy of using only the infusion of oxytocin could be further researched or bolus dose should be as small as possible. The inclusion criteria met only one study investigating different bolus doses and continuous infusion of oxytocin. Kovacheva found out that the clinical effect is similar but additional doses of oxytocin and side effects are lower in the bolus group. The results suggest that prophylactic bolus dose is sufﬁcient [ 15]. The possibility to avoid the infusion dose helps to reduce the total dose of oxytocin. Dufﬁeld compared low and high doses of oxytocin given as a continuous infusion. That study conﬁrmed the previously mentioned result that both low (10 IU) and high (60 IU) infusion of oxytocin works in the same preventive regime [18]. Although Dufﬁeld says that both high and low-dose infusions work in the same way receptor overstimulation should be taken into the consideration. It is known that clinical use of high-dose of oxytocin infusion longer than 3 to 4 h may diminish the response of uterus tonus to oxytocin [ 34]. Robinson and colleagues in their study about oxytocin-induced desensitization of the oxytocin receptor concluded that oxytocin-induced desensitization of myocytes to oxytocin stimulation occurred over a clinically relevant time frame (4.2 h). Continued responsiveness of the cells to prostaglandin stimulation after 6 h of oxytocin pre-treatment indicated that post-receptor signaling pathways were maintained which indicates that the oxytocin receptor is likely involved in the mechanism of myocyte desensitization to oxytocin stimulation [ 34]. Especially if as high as 60 IU doses of oxytocin were used to prevent PPH. High doses work in the same way as low ones do ###11###Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021 18 5029 11 of 14 because receptors cannot bind more hormone molecules to themselves meaning that there is no actual effect on uterine contraction after infusing oxytocin for too long and too much. We included ﬁve studies that had a very similar design. The bolus dose of oxytocin 5 IU was given and it was followed by infusion with placebo or oxytocin. Oxytocin dose ranged between studies from 20 to 40 IU. The conclusion is that additional oxytocin infusion lowers the risk of PPH reduces the need for additional uterotonic agents and does not have a signiﬁcant impact on patients’ hemodynamic [ 19–23]. The discussion remains if and when the oxytocin given as an infusion is for prophylactic or for treatment of uterine atony because the infused oxytocin dose in mentioned studies is more appropriate for uterine atony treatment. The trials investigating the oxytocin effect on uterine tonus during CD have superiority over studies conducted in natural delivery because there is a possibility to evaluate real uterine tonus visually and by palpation and to ﬁnd out the smallest effective dose of the hormone. One more point for discussion is the duration of oxytocin infusion. It is different and ranges from one hour till 24 h between studies. We should take into account that a long-lasting infusion could reduce the sensitivity of oxytocin receptors as mentioned before and oxytocin could lose its power in the case of real uterine atony. Further one more unanswered question is what duration of continuous infusion should be considered as prophylactic. It is known that clinical use of high-dose of oxytocin infusion longer than 3 to 4 h may diminish the response of uterus tonus to oxytocin [34]. The only study of Qian discusses prophylactic oxytocin infusion dose. They found a 95% effective dose to be 7.72 IU/h and that the total oxytocin dose administered after delivery can be decreased if the infusion of oxytocin is given [24]. The international consensus statement on the use of uterotonic agents during caesarean section was published in 2019. Researchers from 8 different countries reached an agreement that oxytocin is the ﬁrst-line drug in both elective and intrapartum CD. For the ﬁrst one bolus of 1 IU oxytocin and infusion starting at 2.5–7.5 IU/h is recommended. For the latter 3 IU oxytocin bolus over 30 s and infusion starting at 7.5–15 IU/h was decided [35]. Oxytocin given in very high doses change the mean level of arterial blood pressure in an opposing manner however under basal physiological conditions oxytocin does not contribute to blood pressure maintenance [ 36]. The hypotensive action of oxytocin demonstrated in animal models is believed to be mediated by the direct effect on oxytocin receptors in the heart and the indirect effect of the release of atrial natriuretic peptide brain natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide in the cardiovascular tissues [ 30]. This hormone has widely known cardiovascular side-effects mostly in decreasing blood pressure by causing peripheral vasodilation increasing the HR cases of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias. Thomas with his colleagues examined the effect of 5 IU bolus and 5 IU oxytocin infusion over 5 min. Both heart rate and blood pressure were lower in the bolus group meaning that bolus should be injected slower than it is widely used [37]. Langesaeter et al. with invasive monitoring (LiDCOPlus®monitor) in healthy preg- nant women observed an increase in cardiac index decreased systemic vascular resistance and systolic blood pressure (range of 36–62 mmHg) 45 s after oxytocin injection [ 38]. This same group of authors studied 18 patients with preeclampsia who underwent ce- sarean section. With the same monitoring as the previous study (LiDCOPlus®) connected to the radial artery of patients the authors found an increased heart rate and decreased systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure in all patients receiving oxytocin (5 IU) after delivery [ 39]. The hemodynamic instability that can occur during postpartum hemor- rhage may not be solely due to hypovolemia but the association of both hypovolemia and use of oxytocin bolus [40]. This review has several limitations. We could apply more strict inclusion criteria and include only randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials. The meta-analysis would provide more reliable results and conclusions; it’s an option for future work. Most studies mentioned the rate of bolus injection and it ranges from 5 s till 3 min [ 10– 15 19–21 23 24]. Further research investigating prophylactic bolus dose infusion rate is ###12###Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021 18 5029 12 of 14 necessary. It is possible that the slower bolus infusion rate could reduce the frequency of side effects or the request of additional doses of uterotonic drugs or even the necessity of oxytocin prophylactic infusion. 5. Conclusions Oxytocin is the routinely used and effective uterotonic drug but the unanswered topic still remains the bolus dose size infusion dose size and requirement and bolus injection rate. The doses that are recommended in the guidelines of peripartum hemorrhage prophylaxis are not conﬁrmed by randomized controlled double-blind trials and are only supported by expert opinion and studies with low evidence rates. Oxytocin bolus 0.5–3 UI is considered an effective prophylactic dose. The effective prophylactic oxytocin infusion dose is 7.72 I U/h. However it is unanswered whether this prophylactic infusion dose of oxytocin is required if an effective bolus dose size and rate are chosen. In the cases we use an oxytocin infusion we should separate if it is the prophylactic infusion or the treatment of atony. Adverse hemodynamic effects were observed when a 5 UI oxytocin bolus was used. This must be taken into consideration especially among female patients with any pre-existing heart conditions.

Abstract OBJECTIVE: To identify and quantify risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage. DATA SOURCES: PubMed CINAHL EMBASE Web of Science and and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for English language studies with no restrictions on date or location. Studies included randomized trials prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case–control studies of pregnant patients who developed atonic postpartum hemorrhage and reported at least one risk factor. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Title abstract and full-text screening were performed using the Raayan web application. Of 1 239 records screened 27 studies were included in this review. Adjusted or unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) relative risks or rate ratios were recorded or calculated. For each risk factor a qualitative synthesis of low and moderate risk of bias studies classifies the risk factor as definite likely unclear or not a risk factor. For risk factors with sufficiently homogeneous definitions and reference ranges a quantitative meta-analysis of low and moderate risk of bias studies was implemented to estimate a combined OR. TABULATION INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Forty-seven potential risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage were identified in this review of which 15 were judged definite or likely risk factors. The remaining 32 assessed risk factors showed no association with atonic postpartum hemorrhage or had conflicting or unclear evidence. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of postpartum hemorrhage occurs in the absence of recognized risk factors. Many risk factors for atonic hemorrhage included in current risk- assessment tools were confirmed with the greatest risk conferred by prior postpartum hemorrhage of any etiology placenta previa placental abruption uterine rupture and multiple gestation. Novel risk factors not currently included in risk-assessment tools included hypertension diabetes and ethnicity. Obesity and magnesium were not associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this review. Corresponding author: Holly B.

Postpartum hemorrhage affects 3–10% of deliveries and accounts for nearly 20% of maternal deaths worldwide.1 2 Although there are many etiologies uterine atony is the most common and accounts for nearly 70% of cases.3 Patients who experience postpartum hemorrhage can have increased morbidity and mortality which can be attenuated by identifying patients at risk early preparation and increased vigilance.1 4 Risk stratification for postpartum hemorrhage is commonly performed using an assessment tool from one of several organizations such as the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative  Association of Women’s Health Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses or the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.5–7 Although these risk-assessment tools have the support of major medical societies recent evidence suggests that the tools have only moderate predictive value for severe hemorrhage in the highest risk groups and that a significant portion of hemorrhages (up to 43%) occur in those deemed low risk.8 9 This limitation may be partly due to the tools’ development via expert consensus opinion and a lack of systematically reviewed evidence to support or refute the included risk factors. A recently published meta-analysis that evaluated the association between maternal demographics and comorbidities and postpartum hemorrhage evaluated only four potential risk factors and found body mass index nulliparity and hypertensive disorders to confer risk of postpartum hemorrhage.11 Additionally existing tools assess the risk of all postpartum hemorrhage etiologies simultaneously which may confound attempts at risk prediction because each etiology of postpartum hemorrhage is likely associated with different risk factors. Furthermore current tools fail to account for the relative contribution of each risk factor or to provide mechanisms to quantify risk for a given patient when more than one risk factor is present. Because each etiology of postpartum hemorrhage likely has a unique set of risk factors evaluating each etiology separately may improve the ability to delineate individual patient risk. The systematic identification and quantification of risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage may allow the development of more reliable weighted risk- stratification tools. Thus this systematic review aimed to identify risk factors that increase the odds of a patient developing postpartum hemorrhage due only to uterine atony after vaginal or cesarean delivery. SOURCES This review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement11 and was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (registration number CRD42020157521). The PubMed (National Library of Medicine) CI-NAHL (EBSCO) EMBASE (Ovid) Web of Science (Clarivate) and ClinicalTrials.gov (National Institutes of Health) databases were searched in November 2018 for English language studies with no restrictions on date or geographic location. PubMed MeSH headings included but were not limited to postpartum hemorrhage; uterine hemorrhage; uterine inertia; causality; epidemiology; incidence; methylergonovine; misoprostol; oxytocin; prevalence; probability; risk assessment; risk factors; and risk in addition to corresponding keywords (full search strategies are shown in Ende et al.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript ###3###Appendix 1 available online at http://links.lww.com/AOG/C163 ). The PubMed search was translated for CINAHL EMBASE Web of Science and clinicaltrials.gov . STUDY SELECTION Eligibility for inclusion was limited to randomized clinical trials prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case–control studies written in the English language with pregnant patients who developed postpartum uterine atony or atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Definitions of atonic postpartum hemorrhage varied by study and included some combination of clinical diagnoses second-line uterotonic administration estimated blood loss need for transfusion or International Classification of Diseases codes (Table 1). Studies were excluded if they reported postpartum hemorrhage data without specifying etiology or if they did not report the incidence of at least one risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage in a uterine atony subgroup. Case reports case series and unpublished meeting abstracts were excluded. Two blinded authors screened abstracts and a third blinded author resolved conflicts. Full-text articles were obtained for all included abstracts. Full-text article review was conducted by the same two blinded authors with conflicts resolved in the same manner. Title abstract and full-text screening were performed using the Raayan web application.12 The risk of bias for each included study was assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies.13 This tool was chosen because of the nonrandomized nature of all included studies as well as its scope in assessing multiple sources of bias  including those related to selection performance detection attrition and reporting. Six domains of risk of bias were assessed including: 1) selection of participants 2) confounding variables 3) measurement of exposure 4) blinding of outcome assessments 5) incomplete outcome data and 6) selective outcome reporting. Bias scoring proceeded after training each scorer on the assessment tool to ensure good inter-rater reliability correlation. Two authors (D.H.C. H.B.E.) independently assessed the risk of bias for each study with disagreements resolved by a third blinded author (J.R.B.). Studies were found to have a low risk of bias if they attained a low-risk classification in all six evaluated domains. Studies were considered a moderate risk of bias if at least one domain was rated unclear risk (but no domains were rated high risk). Finally studies were found to have a high risk of bias if at least one domain was rated high risk. All data were collected independently by co-investigators into a study spreadsheet and verified by a separate author. In addition to baseline study characteristics including country of origin study design the number of patients and inclusion and exclusion criteria data were collected on all risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage reported in the study. For each risk factor adjusted or unadjusted odds ratios (aOR uOR) relative risks (aRR  uRR) or rate ratios (arr urr) were recorded when available. If not explicitly reported uOR and 95% CI were calculated with a 2×2 table using the number of patients with and without a given risk factor who developed atonic postpartum hemorrhage.14 The primary outcome assessed in all studies was the OR RR or rr of risk factors associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. For each identified risk factor low and moderate risk of bias studies were synthesized qualitatively to label each risk factor as definite likely unclear or not a risk factor based on the number of total studies evaluating the factor and percentage of Ende et al.

For risk factors with sufficiently homogeneous definitions and reference ranges a quantitative meta-analysis of low and moderate risk of bias studies was implemented to estimate a combined OR. The inverse variance random effects method was used for meta-analysis.15 This method requires only effect estimates (ie OR or risk ratios) and their SEs. The SEs were estimated by backtransforming the 95% confidence limits using the standard normal distribution. The DerSimonian-Laird estimator was used to estimate the between-study variance in effects.16 Owing to the rarity of uterine atony (and thus the near-equivalence of the OR and RR)  studies that reported a risk ratio were included. Adjusted and unadjusted risk ratios and ORs were included. The I2 statistic and a P-value against the null hypothesis (ie I250) are reported for each subgroup. The I2 statistic represents the percentage of variability in the effect estimates that is attributable to study heterogeneity (compared with sampling heterogeneity). Meta-analysis was implemented in R 3.6.3 (https://www.r-pro ject.org)  using the “metafor” 2.4 add-on package. RESULTS The database search revealed 1 977 total records and 1 239 records were screened after removing duplicates. After excluding 871 records based on title and abstract review 368 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility (Fig. 1). Twenty-seven studies reported data for at least one risk factor for atonic postpartum hemorrhage and were included in the narrative summary. Of those 19 studies contributed data to the qualitative synthesis and 13 to the meta-analysis. Table 1 summarizes the study design patient population study definitions of postpartum hemorrhage and uterine atony and the risk factors assessed in the included studies. The scoring for risk of bias for each study is reported in Figure 2. A total of 47 unique risk factors were identified in the search: 15 relating to maternal history or demographics 11 to maternal comorbidities six pregnancy-related factors eight labor- related factors and seven delivery-related factors. For qualitative comparison the authors characterized each risk factor as definite likely unclear or not a risk factor based on the number of low and moderate risk of bias studies that showed statistically significant evidence that the risk factor was associated with atony (Box 1). Six variables were found to be definite risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage based on either all low and moderate risk of bias studies showing a positive association (if at least three studies) or the majority of low and moderate risk of bias studies showing a positive association (if at least five studies). Definite risk factors included being of Asian race a history of prior postpartum hemorrhage of any etiology in a previous pregnancy preexisting or gestational diabetes mellitus placental disorders (including retained placenta placenta previa vasa previa and placental abruption but excluding abnormal placentation)  prolonged labor (as defined in each study and presented in Appendix 2 available online at http://links.lww.com/AOG/C163 ) and genital tract trauma sustained during delivery. An additional nine variables were deemed likely associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage  and these included being of Hispanic ethnicity nulliparity hypertensive diseases of pregnancy multiple gestation chorioamnionitis uterine rupture predelivery oxytocin exposure induction of labor and instrumented vaginal delivery. Some variables that are Ende et al. Page 4 Obstet Gynecol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 August 04.

These included maternal obesity leiomyomas  polyhydramnios prolonged second stage of labor magnesium exposure and cesarean delivery. Meta-analysis was implemented for 24 risk factors with at least two low or moderate risk of bias studies demonstrating homogeneous risk factor definitions and reference ranges (Figs. 3–7). Table 2 displays a summary of qualitative and quantitative (where applicable) results for each risk factor. Appendix 2 (http://links.lww.com/AOG/ C163 ) includes a complete list of articles that report on each risk factor and the statistical associations reported therein. A narrative summary of all risk factors with the explanations of qualitative and quantitative synthesis results for each factor can be found in Appendix 3  available online at http://links.lww.com/AOG/C163 . Further details on studies reporting on race or ethnicity as risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage including who classified each patient’s race classifications used and data on missing data and “other” classifications  can be found in Appendix 4 available online at http://links.lww.com/AOG/C163 . DISCUSSION This systematic review highlights several previously unrecognized risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage that are not included in current risk-assessment tools and it questions whether other risk factors used in current tools are in fact supported by published evidence. This review also provides further evidence supporting the validity of many risk factors already included in risk-stratification tools and provides quantitative estimates of their contribution to atonic postpartum hemorrhage risk. Although some risk factors presented may cause postpartum hemorrhage independently for example genital tract trauma or abnormal placentation these factors also appear to contribute to uterine atony  and thus are captured in this review. Perhaps most importantly current risk-assessment tools fail to include some definite or likely risk factors that appear to be well-established in the literature. Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.23 95% CI 1.20–1.25) and Asian race (OR 1.39 95% 1.33–1.46) were associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this review and are missing from current risk-assessment tools. The ORs for ethnicity and race are comparable with those for commonly cited risk factors including induction of labor (OR 1.23 95% 1.10–1.39) and macrosomia (OR 1.46  95% 1.35–1.57). Given the mounting evidence of disparities in the care of minority women  we may be failing to anticipate the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage in these populations.17 These associations do not imply causation and it is unclear whether the underlying mechanism of these relationships are biological social or a byproduct of disparities or systematic racism.18 Specific attention must be paid when including race or ethnicity in risk-prediction systems because recent evidence suggests that these algorithms may perpetuate health care disparities.19 20 Hypertensive disease (OR 1.84 95% 1.45–2.33) and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.22 95% 1.08– 1.39) both of which are known to be associated with vascular and perfusion abnormalities  also emerged as previously underappreciated risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage. 21–23 We hypothesize that the vascular pathophysiology of these diseases may contribute Ende et al.

However  high vaginal and cervical lacerations demonstrated higher OR than either instrumented delivery or perineal trauma both of which are included in the Association of Women’s Health Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses’ risk-stratification tool.6 Although nulliparity and prolonged first stage of labor were found to be associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage and are not included in the current risk-assessment tools they may be associated with other risk factors that are included such as induction of labor oxytocin use and chorioamnionitis. Of these factors chorioamnionitis demonstrated the highest OR of 1.93 (95% CI 1.56–2.39) and may contribute significantly to an increased risk associated with nulliparity or prolonged first stage of labor. Finally uterine rupture was found to be associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Although not specifically described in the studies that reported this association hemorrhage attributable to uterine atony presumably occurred after repair of the uterine defect. Additionally some risk factors currently included in risk-assessment tools are not supported by this literature review of atonic postpartum hemorrhage although an association with other etiologies of postpartum hemorrhage would not be captured by this study. Prolonged second stage of labor (which is included in nearly all risk-assessment tools) did not emerge as a definite risk factor for atonic postpartum hemorrhage in our systematic review and meta-analysis with combined OR 1.10 (95% CI 0.82–1.48). Polyhydramnios did not emerge as a risk factor for atonic postpartum hemorrhage in quantitative analysis with combined OR 1.29 (95% CI 0.94–1.76) despite the historical identification of polyhydramnios as a cause of atonic postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine overdistention. Macrosomia and multiple gestation which are implicated by a similar mechanism did demonstrate increased risk with combined OR of 1.46 (95% CI 1.35–1.57) and 2.16 (95% CI 1.53–3.06)  respectively. Uterine overdistention alone however may not fully explain the variability in the risk of atony that is observed between these three conditions. For example multiple gestation pregnancies are frequently due to in vitro fertilization which has been associated with increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage possibly due to abnormalities of placental implantation and endometrial function.26 Additionally there may be some underlying immunologic vascular or genetic pathophysiology that overlaps with infertility and atonic postpartum hemorrhage.27–30 Obesity and magnesium exposure are additional factors included in most risk-assessment tools; however neither showed associations with atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this review. It is possible that the underlying conditions (ie diabetes mellitus hypertension) are the real risk factors as discussed above leaving the clinical impression that obesity and magnesium increase postpartum hemorrhage risk and leading some studies to find a positive effect. Given the retrospective nature of most included studies however magnesium exposure and dosing may have been inadequately captured hindering the ability to demonstrate an association with atonic postpartum hemorrhage.Ende et al.

Because intrapartum cesarean delivery is associated with factors (eg  prolonged labor and oxytocin exposure) shown to increase the risk of atonic postpartum hemorrhage this may contribute to a positive association in studies or a clinical impression that cesarean delivery is significantly associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. The occurrence of leiomyomas varies significantly in size location vascularity and previous surgical interventions which may influence the ability to determine the significance of leiomyomas as a risk factor in published studies. Finally many risk factors already included in widely adopted risk-assessment tools are further confirmed in this systematic review as associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage —prior postpartum hemorrhage multiple gestation placental disorders (previa or abruption) chorioamnionitis predelivery oxytocin exposure induction of labor prolonged labor perineal trauma and instrumented vaginal delivery. Although some of these factors (eg abnormal placentation birth canal trauma) are etiologies for postpartum hemorrhage themselves the evidence presented here suggests that they are additionally associated with the development of uterine atony. This evidence further supports the inclusion of these factors when stratifying risk and our data may help health care professionals improve tools by assigning a quantitative weight to risk factors with a stronger association with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally current tools likely can be further improved by more nuanced definitions of some factors shown to have a robust association with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. For example further delineation of genital tract trauma may be warranted; although episiotomy or perineal tear (OR 1.67 95% 1.28–2.18) is included in some current risk-assessment tools high vaginal laceration and cervical laceration are not (OR 2.19 95% 1.13–4.24 and 5.70 95% 2.56–12.67 respectively). The data for oxytocin exposure which also are already included in current risk-assessment tools presented the most significant challenge in the interpretation of results for this systematic review. Although qualitative synthesis suggested an association between predelivery oxytocin exposure and atonic postpartum hemorrhage the meta-analysis failed to confirm the association (combined OR 1.15 95% 0.95–1.40). Importantly two low risk of bias studies were not included in the meta-analysis because of heterogeneity in defining the exposure and reference ranges (eg evaluating oxytocin per unit dose). With conflicting results it is essential also to consider the mechanism by which oxytocin likely contributes to atonic postpartum hemorrhage namely that tachyphylaxis to oxytocin occurs during labor  thereby decreasing efficacy of the primary drug used for the active management the third stage of labor.31–33 Further investigation is needed to determine the cut-offs for the amount or duration of oxytocin that leads to an increased risk of atony. Although the risk-assessment tools may be refined by adding keeping or removing risk factors the individual weights and whether each individually or in combination defines an individual patient’s postpartum hemorrhage risk as moderate or high remains undetermined. When preparing and allocating resources for potential postpartum hemorrhage the use of risk scores that weigh the variable contribution of risk factors may be preferable to the use of tools that merely collate a list of diagnoses with many associated or overlapping risk factors.

The strengths of this systematic review include the systematic approach to identifying all publications that included risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage and the division of risk factors into maternal pregnancy-related labor-related and delivery-related conditions to provide a logical progression of possible etiologies of atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Finally we evaluated each variable both qualitatively and quantitatively to summarize a large number of studies in a comprehensive review. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis however must be considered in the context of several limitations. First we had to accept the authors’ definitions of atonic postpartum hemorrhage which varied from study to study. The most common definitions in large database studies were rather consistent using International Classification of Diseases codes for postpartum hemorrhage due to atony. The variability occurred primarily in the smaller studies which used definitions of postpartum hemorrhage that included estimated blood loss postpartum hemoglobin or hematocrit drop and clinical diagnosis with additional definitions for the diagnosis of atony including uterotonic administration medical team diagnosis or other surgical interventions. These definitions represent a spectrum of pathology and each study’s definition may have affected the magnitude of associations of any given risk factor. Second  because all authors were fluent only in English we restricted our search to English-language studies which contributed to publication bias. Third for thoroughness we did include in the narrative summary studies with a high risk of bias; however we included only studies with a low or moderate risk of bias when evaluating each risk factor both qualitatively and quantitatively. Fourth the types of effect estimates reported and the factors used to adjust for potential confounding were heterogeneous across studies. Additionally nearly all reported ORs and RRs reflect weak associations (range 1–2) which are likely below the discriminatory ability of the included cohort and case–control studies. These observations may result from unmeasured bias or confounding.35 Lastly to summarize risk factors qualitatively we had to provide a unique definition to categorize a risk factor as definite  likely or unclear. Although these definitions were created de novo for this review a post hoc evaluation revealed that for those variables designated definite risk factors all (six of six) showed statistically significant combined OR. Of the variables designated likely eight of nine were amenable to meta-analysis and seven showed statistically significant increased odds of atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Finally 15 variables were classified as unclear risk factors with only six of those demonstrating data homogeneous enough for meta-analysis  and of those only one (macrosomia) demonstrated a statistically significant OR. In summary this systematic review and meta-analysis of risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony provides critical insights to help guide future obstetric care. By more narrowly defining our focus to only atonic postpartum hemorrhage we aimed to provide more definitive evidence supporting or refuting presumed risk factors given that each etiology of postpartum hemorrhage likely has a unique set of contributing factors. These findings should lead researchers and clinicians to refine current risk-assessment tools further. Future tools should include weighted values for risk factors or modeling risk levels Ende et al.

PPH is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly one quarter of all maternal deaths	globally.	Most	deaths	resulting	from	PPH	occur	during	the	first	24	hours	after	 birth:	the	majority	of	these	could	be	avoided	through	the	use	of	prophylactic	utero - tonics during the third stage of labour and by timely and appropriate management. Improving health care for women during childbirth in order to prevent and treat PPH is an essential step towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The primary objective of this guideline therefore is to provide a foundation for the strategic policy and programme development needed to ensure the sustainable implementation of effective interventions for reducing the global burden of PPH. Guideline development methods The procedures used in the development of this guideline are outlined in the “ WHO handbook for guideline development ”1.	Briefly 	these	procedures	are:	(i)	the	identi - fication	of	questions	related	to	clinical	practice	and	health	policy	for	which	answers	 are	needed 	(ii)	the	retrieval	of	up-to-date	research-based	evidence 	(iii)	the	as - sessment	and	synthesis	of	evidence 	(iv)	the	formulation	of	recommendations	using	 input	from	a	wide	range	of	stakeholders 	and	(v)	the	formulation	of	plans	for	the	 dissemination 	implementation 	impact	evaluation	and	updating	of	the	guideline.	 The	scientific	evidence	for	the	recommendations	was	synthesized	using	the	Grading	 of	Recommendations	 Assessment 	Development	and	Evaluation	(GRADE)	methodol - ogy.	For	each	of	the	previous	WHO	recommendations	on	PPH	(2007	and	2009)	and	 for	all	the	newly-added	questions 	evidence	profiles	were	prepared	based	on	22	 up-to-date systematic reviews. The revised and new recommendations were devel - oped	and	adopted	by	an	international	group	of	experts	who	participated	in	the	WHO	 Technical	Consultation	on	the	Prevention	and	 Treatment	of	PPH 	held	in	Montreux 	 Switzerland 	6–8	March	2012.	 The WHO Technical Consultation adopted 32 recommendations and these are shown in	Boxes	 A 	B	and	C.	For	each	recommendation 	the	quality	of	the	supporting	evi - dence	is	graded	as	‘very	low’ 	‘low’ 	‘moderate’ 	or	‘high’.	 The	contributing	stake - holders	qualified	the	strength	of	these	recommendations	by	taking	the	quality	of	the	 evidence and other factors into account (including the values and preferences of stakeholders 	the	magnitude	of	effect 	the	balance	of	benefits	versus	disadvantages 	 resource	usage 	and	the	feasibility	of	each	recommendation).	 To	ensure	that	each	 recommendation	is	correctly	understood	and	used	in	practice 	additional	remarks	 have	also	been	included 	and	these	are	noted	in	the	full	document	below	the	recom - mendations.	Readers	should	refer	to	these	remarks	in	the	full	version	of	the	guide - line if they are in any doubt about the meaning of each recommendation. 1 WHO handbook for guideline development .	Geneva 	World	Health	Organization 	2012. ###10###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 4 Recommendations for PPH prevention The intrinsic contribution of each component of the ‘active management of the third	stage	of	labour’ 	was	examined	in	light	of	new	available	evidence 	and	relevant	 recommendations were made. All women giving birth should be offered uterotonics during	the	third	stage	of	labour	for	the	prevention	of	PPH;	oxytocin	(IM/IV 	10	IU)	 is recommended as the uterotonic drug of choice. Other injectable uterotonics and misoprostol are recommended as alternatives for the prevention of PPH in settings where	oxytocin	is	unavailable.	 The	importance	of	controlled	cord	traction	(CCT)	was	 revisited because of new evidence. This intervention is now regarded as optional in	settings	where	skilled	birth	attendants	are	available 	and	is	contraindicated	in	 settings	where	skilled	attendants	do	not	assist	with	births.	Early	cord	clamping	is	 generally contraindicated. Continuous uterine massage is not recommended as an intervention	to	prevent	PPH	in	women	who	have	received	prophylactic	oxytocin 	 as	it	may	cause	maternal	discomfort 	require	a	dedicated	health	professional 	and	 may	not	lead	to	a	reduction	of	blood	loss.	However 	surveillance	of	uterine	tonus	 through	abdominal	palpation	is	recommended	in	all	women	for	early	identification	 of	postpartum	uterine	atony.	In	summary 	the	Guideline	Development	Group	(GDG)	 considered the use of uterotonics as the main intervention within the active man - agement	of	third	stage	of	labour	package.	In	this	context 	the	use	of	misoprostol	for	 the	prevention	of	PPH	by	community	health	care	workers	and	lay	health	workers	is	 supported	in	settings	where	skilled	birth	attendants	are	not	present. The GDG also issued recommendations for reducing blood loss during the third stage of	labour	in	caesarean	sections.	Oxytocin	is	the	recommended	uterotonic	drug	for	 the prevention of PPH in caesarean sections. Cord traction is recommended in pref - erence to manual removal when assisting placental delivery in caesarean sections. Recommendations for PPH treatment The	use	of	uterotonics	(oxytocin	alone	as	the	first	choice)	plays	a	central	role	in	 the	treatment	of	PPH.	Uterine	massage	is	recommended	for	the	treatment	of	PPH	 as	soon	as	it	is	diagnosed 	and	initial	fluid	resuscitation	with	isotonic	crystalloids	is	 recommended.	 The	use	of	tranexamic	acid	is	advised	in	cases	of	refractory	atonic	 bleeding or persistent trauma-related bleeding. The use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is recommended for refractory bleeding or if uterotonics are unavail - able.	Bimanual	uterine	compression 	external	aortic	compression 	and	the	use	of	 non-pneumatic	anti-shock	garments	are	recommended	as	temporizing	measures	until	 substantive care is available. If there is persistent bleeding and the relevant re - sources	are	available 	uterine	artery	embolization	should	be	considered.	If	bleeding	 persists 	despite	treatment	with	uterotonic	drugs	and	other	conservative	interven - tions 	surgical	intervention	should	be	used	without	further	delay. If	the	third	stage	of	labour	lasts	more	than	30	minutes 	CCT 	and	IV/IM	oxytocin	 (10	IU)	should	be	used	to	manage	the	retained	placenta.	If	the	placenta	is	retained	 and	bleeding	occurs 	the	manual	removal	of	the	placenta	should	be	expedited.	 Whenever	the	manual	removal	of	the	placenta	is	undertaken 	a	single	dose	of	pro - phylactic antibiotics is recommended. The GDG also issued recommendations related to the organization of PPH care. Health facilities delivering maternity services should adopt formal protocols for the prevention and treatment of PPH and for patient referral. The use of PPH treatment ###11###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 5 simulations for pre-service and in-service training programmes was recommended. Finally 	the	GDG	recommended	that	the	use	of	uterotonics	for	the	prevention	of	PPH	 should	be	monitored	and	a	specific	indicator	was	suggested. Box A: Recommendations for the prevention of PPH 1.

Background Postpartum	Haemorrhage	(PPH)	is	commonly	defined	as	a	blood	loss	of	500	ml	or	 more	within	24	hours	after	birth 	while	severe	PPH	is	defined	as	a	blood	loss	of	 1000	ml	or	more	within	the	same	timeframe.	PPH	affects	approximately	2%	of	all	 women	who	give	birth:	it	is	associated	not	only	with	nearly	one	quarter	of	all	ma - ternal deaths globally but is also the leading cause of maternal mortality in most low-income	countries.	PPH	is	a	significant	contributor	to	severe	maternal	morbidity	 and long-term disability as well as to a number of other severe maternal conditions generally	 associated	 with	more	substantial	 blood	loss 	including	 shock	and	 organ	dys - function.	(1–3) Uterine	atony	is	the	most	common	cause	of	PPH 	but	genital	tract	trauma	(i.e.	vagi - nal	or	cervical	lacerations) 	uterine	rupture 	retained	placental	tissue 	or	maternal	 coagulation disorders may also result in PPH. Although the majority of women who experience	PPH	complications	have	no	identifiable	clinical	or	historical	risk	factors 	 grand	multiparity	and	multiple	gestation	are	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	 bleeding	after	birth.	PPH	may	be	aggravated	by	pre-existing	anaemia	and 	in	such	 instances 	the	loss	of	a	smaller	volume	of	blood	may	still	result	in	adverse	clinical	 sequelae.	(4) During	the	second	half	of	the	20th	century 	a	package	of	interventions	performed	 during the third stage of labour became the cornerstone for the prevention of PPH.	This	approach	became	known	as	the	“active	management	of	the	third	stage	 of	labour”	and	consisted	initially	of	the	following	components:	the	administration	 of	a	prophylactic	uterotonic	after	the	delivery	of	a	baby 	early	cord	clamping	and	 cutting 	and	the	controlled	traction	of	the	umbilical	cord.	Uterine	massage	is	also	 frequently included as part of the active management of the third stage of labour. In contrast to active	management 	 expectant management involves instead waiting for signs of placenta separation and allows for the placenta to be delivered sponta - neously 	or	aided	by	nipple	stimulation	or	gravity.	Compared	with	expectant	man - agement 	the	active	management	of	the	third	stage	of	labour	is	associated	with	a	 substantial	reduction	in	the	occurrence	of	PPH.	(5) It	is	generally	assumed	that	by	preventing	and	treating	PPH 	most	PPH-associated	 deaths could be avoided. The prevention and treatment of PPH are therefore vital steps towards improving the health care of women during childbirth and the achievement	of	the	Millennium	Development	Goals.	 To	reach	these	objectives 	 health	workers	in	developing	countries	should	be	given	access	to	appropriate	medi - cations and be trained in procedures relevant to the management of PPH. Countries also need evidence-based guidance to inform their health policies and improve their health outcomes. Given	the	availability	of	new	scientific	evidence	related	to	the	prevention	and	treat - ment	of	PPH 	the	aim	of	this	document	is	to	revise	previous	WHO	recommendations	 for the prevention and treatment of PPH and to add new recommendations. The primary goal of this guideline is to provide a foundation for the implementation of strategic policy and programme developments for interventions shown to have been effective in reducing the burden of PPH. Health professionals responsible for de - veloping national and local protocols and health policies constitute the main target audience	of	this	document.	Obstetricians 	midwives 	general	medical	practitioners 	 health	care	managers	and	public	health	policy-makers 	particularly	in	under-re - ###15###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 9 sourced settings are also targeted. The guidance provided is evidence-informed and covers topics related to the management of PPH that were selected and prioritized by	an	international 	multidisciplinary	group	of	health	care	workers 	consumers	and	 other	stakeholders.	 This	document	establishes	general	principles	of	PPH	care	and	it	 is intended to inform the development of protocols and health policies related to PPH. This document is not intended to provide a comprehensive practical guide for the prevention and treatment of PPH. 2. Methods This guideline is an update of the “ WHO recommendations for the prevention of PPH” published in 2007 and the “ WHO guidelines for the management of PPH and retained placenta ”	published	in	2009	(6 7).	 This	document	represents	WHO’s	nor - mative support for using evidence-informed policies and practices in all countries. The	guideline	forms	part	of	a	WHO	knowledge-to-action	project	entitled	GREAT 	 (Guideline	development 	Research	priorities 	Evidence	synthesis 	 Applicability	of	 evidence 	 Transfer	of	knowledge)	(8)	and	was	developed	using	standardized	operat - ing procedures in accordance with the process described in the “WHO handbook for guideline development ” (9).	In	summary 	the	process	included:	(i) the	identification	 of	critical	questions	and	critical	outcomes 	(ii) the	retrieval	of	the	evidence 	(iii)	the	 assessment	and	synthesis	of	evidence 	(iv) the	formulation	of	recommendations 	and	 (v) planning	for	the	dissemination 	implementation 	impact	evaluation	and	updating	 of the guideline. Two	technical	groups	have	worked	in	the	development	of	this	guideline.	 A	small	 operative	group	composed	of	staff	from	the	WHO’s	Department	of	Reproductive	 Health	and	Research 	and	Department	of	Maternal 	Newborn 	Child	and	 Adolescent	 Health	(MCA) 	as	well	as	two	external	experts	(see	 Annex	1	–	 The	guideline	steer - ing	group)	and	a	larger	group	with	international	stakeholders	including	midwives 	 obstetricians 	neonatologists 	researchers 	experts	in	research	synthesis 	experts	in	 health	care	programmes 	and	consumer	representatives	(the	Guideline	Development	 Group	–	GDG).	 The	guideline	steering	group	was	formed	in	the	very	beginning	of	the	 project and reviewed the previous WHO guidelines on prevention and treatment of PPH	(6 7).	 This	group	prepared	a	list	of	potential	additional	questions	related	to	the	 prevention	and	treatment	of	PPH.	Next 	the	GDG	reviewed	and	prioritized	the	draft	 questions. The guideline steering group then produced a list of all the questions to be addressed. This included both questions from the earlier versions of the guideline as well as new ones. The guideline steering group also adopted the outcomes used in	the	2007	and	2009	guideline	documents.	 These	outcomes 	as	before 	were	rated	 on	a	scale	from	1	to	9.	 A	question	or	outcome	was	defined	as	‘critical’ 	if	it	was	given	 an	average	score	of	7	or	more.	Questions	and	outcomes	with	a	score	of	between	 4	and	6	were	considered	‘important	but	not	critical’ 	while	those	with	a	score	lower	 than 4 were not considered to be important for the purposes of the guideline  (Annex	2). ###16###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 10 Cochrane	systematic	reviews	of	randomized	controlled	trials	(RCTs)	were	the	pri - mary source of evidence for the recommendations2.	Using	the	assembled	list	of	 questions	and	outcomes 	the	guideline	steering	group	identified	Cochrane	systematic	 reviews that were either relevant or potentially relevant and then evaluated wheth - er	any	needed	updating.	 A	review	was	considered	to	be	outdated	if	the	last	specified	 date	for	new	trial	searches	was	two	years	ago	or	more 	or	if	there	were	relevant	 studies	still	awaiting	assessment 	as	identified	by	the	standard	search	procedures	of	 the	Cochrane	Pregnancy	and	Childbirth	Group.	Updates	were	performed	using	spe - cific	standard	search	strategies.	 The	corresponding	authors	of	the	outdated	reviews	 were	invited	to	update	them	within	a	specified	time	period.	In	instances	in	which	 the	corresponding	authors	were	unable	to	do	so 	the	updates	were	undertaken	by	 members of the guideline steering group. The search strategies employed to identify the	trials	and	the	specific	criteria	for	trial	inclusion	and	exclusion	are	described	in	 the individual systematic reviews. A systematic review of literature that included non-randomized trials was carried out by the guideline steering group members when	randomized-trial	data	related	to	specific	questions	were	scarce. The	following	procedures	were	used	to	extract	the	evidence	for	this	guideline	from	 each	of	these	systematic	reviews:	first 	the	most	recent	version	of	the	Review	 Manager	(RevMan)	file	was	retrieved	from	the	Cochrane	Pregnancy	and	Childbirth	 Cochrane	Group	and	customized	to	reflect	the	key	comparisons	and	outcomes	(those	 that	were	not	relevant	to	the	guideline	were	excluded).	 Then	the	RevMan	file	was	 exported	to	the	GRADE	profiler	software	(Grading	of	Recommendations	 Assessment 	 Development	 and	Evaluation)	 and	GRADE	criteria	 were	used	to	critically	 appraise	 the	 retrieved	scientific	evidence.	Finally 	evidence	profiles	(in	the	form	of	GRADE	tables)	 were prepared for each comparison. An online content management system devel - oped	for	the	GREAT 	project 	namely	the	 Guideline Production System  was used to handle	and	share	electronic	files. The evidence presented in the GRADE tables was derived from a larger body of data extracted	primarily	from	Cochrane	reviews	which 	in	many	cases 	contained	multiple	 comparisons	(Evidence	Base	(EB)	 Tables	1	to	70).	Each	GRADE	table	relates	to	one	 specific	question	or	comparison 	but	some	GRADE	tables	do	not	contain	data	for	all	 critical outcomes. This is because data for those outcomes were not available in the Cochrane reviews. The raw data which constitute the basis of the GRADE tables are not	included	in	this	document 	but	readers	interested	in	how	these	GRADE	tables	 were constructed may request access to this information. The guideline steering group	used	the	information	presented	in	the	GRADE	tables	to	check	if	any	existing	 recommendations	(included	in	the	2007	or	2009	documents)	needed	to	be	revised 	 and to draft recommendations that related to the new questions. Each recom - mendation was allocated to a thematic module which included the narrative sum - maries of evidence and the relevant GRADE tables. The standardized criteria used in	grading	the	evidence	and	the	thematic	modules	(including	the	GRADE	tables)	 are not included in this document . They have been published separately online in a document entitled “ WHO recommendations for preventing and treating PPH: evidence base ”	(www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perina - tal_health/9789241548502/en). 2	As	part	of	the	Cochrane	pre-publication	editorial	process 	reviews	are	commented	on	by	three	peers	 (one	editor	and	two	referees	external	to	the	editorial	team)	and	the	Group’s	Statistical	 Adviser	(see	 http://www.cochrane.org/cochrane-reviews ).	“The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Inter ­ ventions ” describes in detail the process of preparing and maintaining Cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of health care interventions. ###17###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 11 A preliminary online consultation was held to review the draft recommendations. The draft recommendations and supporting evidence were made available to a large number	of	international	stakeholders	who	were	then	asked	to	respond	to	an	online	 survey.	In	addition 	the	preliminary	online	consultation	identified	other	previous	 recommendations that needed to be discussed at the WHO Technical Consultation on	the	Prevention	and	 Treatment	of	PPH	held	in	Montreux 	Switzerland 	6–8	March	 2012.	A	subset	of	the	international	group	of	experts	(who	had	participated	in	the	 online	consultations)	and	other	additional	experts	were	invited	to	attend	the	 Techni - cal	Consultation	(see	 Annex	1	for	a	full	list	of	participants).	 The	draft	recommen - dations 	the	narrative	summaries	of	evidence 	the	GRADE	tables	for	the	new	and	 previous	recommendations 	and	other	related	documents	were	provided	in	advance	 to	participants.	Balance	worksheets	were	used	during	the	 Technical	Consultation	to	 summarize	the	values 	preferences	and	judgements	made	about	the	strength	of	the	 new and revised recommendations. Declaration of interest by participants in the WHO Technical Con - sultation According	to	WHO	regulations 	all	experts	must	declare	their	relevant	interests	prior	 to participation in WHO meetings. All GDG members and participants were therefore required to complete a Declaration of Interest Form before the meeting. These were reviewed by the guideline steering group before the group composition and invita - tions	were	finalized.	 The	external	advisers	also	verbally	declared	potential	conflicts	 of interest at the beginning of the meeting. The procedures for the management of	conflicts	of	interests	were	undertaken	in	accordance	with	the	“ WHO guidelines for declaration of interests (WHO experts) ”.	In	summary 	all	members	of	the	GDG	 declared	that	they	had	no	commercial	or	financial	interests	that	were	directly	or	 indirectly	related	to	the	topic	of	the	meeting/guideline.	Seven	members	of	the	 GDG	were	involved	in	academic	work	related	to	the	topic	of	the	guideline 	but	this	 involvement	was	not	considered	to	be	a	conflict	of	interest	and	the	full	participation	 of	all	the	selected	experts	was	deemed	appropriate.	 A	table	summarizing	the	decla - rations	of	interest	made	by	members	of	the	GDG	is	included	in	 Annex	1.	 Decision-making during the Technical Consultation At	the	beginning	of	the	 Technical	Consultation 	the	participants	discussed	and	ad - opted a list of recommendations which needed to be addressed during the meeting. This included the new recommendations as well as previous recommendations that needed to be reviewed and possibly revised. The	following	protocol	was	used	for	the	 Technical	Consultation:	the	meeting	was	 structured to allow participants to discuss the proposed list of recommendations and these	recommendations	were	revised 	as	needed 	through	group	discussion.	 The	final	 adoption	of	each	recommendation	was	made	by	consensus	–	defined	as	the	agree - ment by three quarters or more of the participants – provided that those who dis - agreed did not feel strongly about their position. Strong disagreements were record - ed	as	such	in	the	guideline.	If	the	participants	were	unable	to	reach	a	consensus 	 the	disputed	recommendation 	or	any	other	decision 	was	put	to	a	vote.

WHO staff	attending	the	meeting 	external	technical	experts	involved	in	the	collection	 ###18###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 12 and	grading	of	the	evidence 	and	observers	were	not	eligible	to	vote.	In	addition	to	 discussing	the	scientific	evidence	and	its	quality 	relevant	applicability	issues 	costs	 and	other	judgements	were	also	taken	into	consideration	when	formulating	the	final	 recommendations. The strength of each recommendation was determined during the Technical Con - sultation.	By	default 	the	strength	of	the	recommendations	discussed	was	aligned	 initially with the quality of the evidence (i.e. at	the	start	of	the	discussion 	strong	 recommendations	were	based	on	evidence	of	‘moderate’ 	and	‘high’ 	quality 	while	 weak	recommendations	were	based	on	evidence	of	‘low’ 	and	‘very	low’ 	quality).	  In	addition	to	the	quality	of	the	evidence 	the	following	factors	were	considered	 when	determining	the	final	recommendation	and	its	strength:	values	and	preferenc - es 	the	magnitude	of	effect 	the	balance	of	benefits	versus	disadvantages 	resource	 usage 	and	feasibility.	Values	and	preferences 	resource	usage 	and	the	feasibility	of	 each	recommendation	were	based	on	the	experience	and	opinion	of	the	GDG	mem - bers.	Balance	worksheets	were	used	to	note	and	synthesize	these	considerations	 (Annex	3 	Boxes	1	to	8)	and	record	the	reasons	for	changes	made	to	the	default	 strength of the recommendations. Document preparation and peer review Prior	to	the	 Technical	Consultation 	the	guideline	steering	group	prepared	a	prelimi - nary version of this document using a guideline reporting template which had been developed	as	part	of	the	WHO’s	GREAT 	project.	 The	draft	guideline	was	reviewed	by	 Technical	Consultation	participants	at	the	meeting	in	Montreux.	During	the	meeting 	 the	draft	guideline	was	modified	in	line	with	participant	deliberation	and	comments.	 Feedback	received	during	the	preliminary	online	consultation	was	also	discussed	and	 incorporated	into	the	document	where	appropriate.	 After	the	meeting 	members	of	 the	guideline	steering	group	worked	to	ensure	that	a	revised	version	of	the	docu - ment	accurately	reflected	the	deliberations	and	decisions	of	the	participants.	 The	 revised	draft	guideline	document	was	sent	to	two	external	peer	reviewers	and	their	 inputs were carefully evaluated by the guideline steering group and document revi - sions	made	accordingly.	 The	guideline	steering	group	refrained	from	making	substan - tive	changes	after	the	meeting	in	Montreux	to	the	guideline	scoping	(such	as	the	 further	expansion	of	the	guideline	scoping)	or	to	the	recommendations.	 The	revised	 version was returned electronically to those who had attended the Technical Consul - tation for their approval. 3. Results This guideline includes 32 recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PPH.	Seven	of	these	recommendations	are	new 	while	the	others	have	been	revised	 in light of new evidence. Most of the previous 2007 and 2009 recommendations remain	unchanged	in	essence 	despite	updates	to	the	evidence	base.	 The	wording	 of the previous recommendations has been revised to enhance the clarity of the guidance provided. The recommendations included in this guideline are based on a	total	of	22	Cochrane	systematic	reviews	summarized	in	70	GRADE	tables.	Boxes	 1 to 8 present the most up-to-date WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment	of	PPH.	Where	applicable 	remarks	related	to	specific	recommendations	 are	also	shown	in	these	boxes	and	new	recommendations	are	marked	with	asterisks.	 Narrative summaries of evidence supporting the recommendations are presented ###19###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 13 in	the	electronic	appendix	together	with	the	corresponding	GRADE	tables	(see	the	 “WHO recommendations for preventing and treating PPH: evidence base ” at  www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/  9789241548502/en).	Box	9	presents	statements	related	to	topics	for	which 	accord - ing	to	the	assessments	of	the	GDG 	there	was	insufficient	evidence	to	issue	a	recom - mendation.	Balance	worksheets	summarizing	the	values 	preferences	and	judge - ments	made	about	the	strength	of	the	recommendations	are	presented	in	 Annex	3 	 Boxes	1	to	8. The	development	of	these	recommendations	involved	130	stakeholders	who	par - ticipated	in	the	online	preliminary	survey	(representing	all	WHO	regions) 	and	25	 experts	who	participated	in	the	WHO	 Technical	Consultation. Recommendations for PPH prevention The contribution of each component of the ‘active management of the third stage of labour’	was	examined	in	light	of	new	available	evidence 	and	relevant	recommenda - tions	were	made.	Box	1	presents	recommendations	concerning	the	use	of	uteroton - ics for the prevention of PPH. All women giving birth should be offered uteroton - ics	during	the	third	stage	of	labour	to	prevent	PPH	and	IM/IV	oxytocin	(10	IU)	is	 recommended as the uterotonic drug of choice. Other injectable uterotonics (i.e. ergometrine/methylergometrine 	or	the	fixed	drug	combination	of	oxytocin	and	 ergometrine)	and	misoprostol	are	recommended	as	alternatives	for	the	prevention	 of	PPH	in	settings	where	oxytocin	is	unavailable.	Box	2	contains	recommendations	 related to cord management and uterine massage. The importance of controlled cord	traction	(CCT)	was	revisited	because	of	new	evidence.	 This	intervention	is	now	 regarded	as	optional	in	settings	where	skilled	birth	attendants	are	available 	and	 is	contraindicated	in	settings	where	skilled	attendants	do	not	assist	with	births.	 Early cord clamping is generally contraindicated. Continuous uterine massage is not recommended as an intervention to prevent PPH for women who have received prophylactic	oxytocin 	because	the	massage	may	cause	maternal	discomfort 	re - quire	a	dedicated	health	professional 	and	may	not	lead	to	a	reduction	of	blood	loss.	 However 	surveillance	of	the	uterine	tonus	through	abdominal	palpation	is	recom - mended	for	all	women	for	the	early	identification	of	postpartum	uterine	atony.	 Table	 1 summarizes the recommendation status of the individual components of the active management	of	the	third	stage	of	labour.	In	summary 	the	GDG	considered	the	use	 of uterotonics as the main intervention within the active management of third stage of	labour	package.	In	this	context 	the	use	of	misoprostol	for	the	prevention	of	PPH	 by	community	health	care	workers	and	lay	health	workers	is	supported	in	settings	 where	skilled	birth	attendants	are	not	present. Recommendations for reducing blood loss during the third stage of labour in caesar - ean	sections	are	presented	in	Box	3.	Oxytocin	is	the	recommended	uterotonic	drug	 for the prevention of PPH in caesarean sections. Cord traction is recommended in preference to manual removal when assisting placental delivery in caesarean sec - tions. Recommendations for PPH treatment The	use	of	uterotonics	(oxytocin	alone	as	the	first	choice)	plays	a	central	role	in	 the	treatment	of	PPH	(see	Boxes	4	and	5).	Uterine	massage	is	recommended	for	the	 treatment	of	PPH	as	soon	as	it	is	diagnosed	(see	Box	6)	and	the	initial	fluid	resus - ###20###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 14 citation	with	isotonic	crystalloids	is	recommended.	 The	use	of	tranexamic	acid	is	 advised in cases of refractory atonic bleeding or persistent trauma-related bleed - ing	(see	Box	5).	 The	use	of	intrauterine	balloon	tamponade	is	recommended	for	 refractory	bleeding	or	if	uterotonics	are	unavailable.	Bimanual	uterine	compression 	 external	aortic	compression 	and	the	use	of	non-pneumatic	anti-shock	garments	are	 recommended as temporizing measures until substantive care is available. If there is persistent	bleeding	and	the	relevant	resources	are	available 	uterine	artery	emboli - zation should be considered. If bleeding persists despite treatment with uterotonic drugs	and	other	conservative	interventions 	surgical	intervention	should	be	used	 without further delay. If	the	third	stage	of	labour	lasts	more	than	30	minutes 	CCT 	and	IV/IM	oxytocin	  (10	IU)	should	be	used	to	manage	the	retained	placenta.	If	the	placenta	is	retained	 and	bleeding	occurs 	the	manual	removal	of	the	placenta	should	be	expedited.	 Whenever	the	manual	removal	of	the	placenta	is	undertaken 	a	single	dose	of	pro - phylactic	antibiotics	is	recommended	(see	Box	7). The GDG also issued recommendations related to the organization of PPH care (see Box	8).	Health	facilities	delivering	maternity	services	should	adopt	formal	proto - cols for the prevention and treatment of PPH and for patient referral. The use of PPH treatment simulations for pre-service and in-service training programmes was recommended.	Finally 	the	GDG	recommended	that	the	use	of	uterotonics	for	the	 prevention	of	PPH	should	be	monitored	and	a	specific	indicator	was	suggested. The	GDG	found	insufficient	evidence	to	recommend	one	route	over	another	for	the	 prevention	of	PPH	with	oxytocin 	the	use	of	recombinant	factor	VIIa	for	the	treat - ment	of	PPH 	intraumbilical	vein	injection	of	oxytocin	for	treatment	of	retained	 placenta 	and	the	antenatal	distribution	of	misoprostol.	 The	GDG	also	found	insuffi - cient evidence to recommend self-administration for the prevention of PPH and the measurement	of	blood	loss	over	clinical	estimation	(see	Box	9). ###21###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 15 Box 1: Recommendations for the prevention of PPH – uterotonics 1. The use of uterotonics for the prevention of PPH during the third stage of labour is recom - mended	for	all	births.	(Strong	recommendation 	moderate-quality	evidence) 2.

(Strong	recommendation 	moderate- quality	evidence) Remarks •	Available	comparisons	are	limited 	but	a	significant	difference	between	the	benefits	of	oxytocin	and	 ergometrine	is	unlikely.	 These	recommendations	place	a	high	value	on	avoiding	the	adverse	effects	of	 ergometrine	and	assume	a	similar	benefit	from	using	oxytocin	and	ergometrine	for	the	prevention	of	 PPH. •	Caution	should	be	exercised	when	opting	for	ergot	derivatives	for	the	prevention	of	PPH	as	these	drugs	 have	clear	contraindications	in	women	with	hypertensive	disorders.	 Thus 	it	is	probably	safer	to	avoid	 the use of ergot derivatives in unscreened populations. •	Misoprostol	(600	�g	PO)	was	regarded	by	the	GDG	as	an	effective	drug	for	the	prevention	of	PPH.

How - ever 	the	GDG	considered	the	relative	benefits	of	oxytocin	compared	to	misoprostol	in	preventing	blood	 loss 	as	well	as	the	increased	adverse	effects	of	misoprostol	compared	to	oxytocin.	 The	GDG	acknowl - edged	that	there	is	no	evidence	to	show	that	a	600 µg	dose	of	misoprostol	provides	greater	efficacy	over	 a	400�g	�g	dose.	Lower	doses	have	a	lower	side-effect	profi 	le	but	the	effi 	cacy	of	lower	doses	of	miso-�g	�g	dose.	Lower	doses	have	a	lower	side-effect	profi 	le	but	the	effi 	cacy	of	lower	doses	of	miso-	dose.	Lower	doses	have	a	lower	side-effect	profile	but	the	efficacy	of	lower	doses	of	miso - prostol	has	not	been	evaluated	sufficiently. •	The	recommendations	concerning	alternative	uterotonics	should	not	detract	from	the	objective	of	mak - ing	oxytocin	as	widely	accessible	as	possible. •	In view of past concerns regarding the community-level distribution of misoprostol and the potential for	serious	consequences	of	administration	before	birth 	the	GDG	places	emphasis	on	training	persons	 administering	misoprostol	and	monitoring	community	distribution	interventions	with	scientifically	sound	 methods and appropriate indicators. ###22###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 16 Box 2: Recommendations for the prevention of PPH – cord management and uterine massage 5.

(10)	 •	The recommendations for the timing of cord clamping apply equally to preterm and term births. The GDG	considers	the	benefits	of	delayed	clamping	for	preterm	infants	to	be	particularly	important.•	Some	health	professionals	working	in	areas	of	high	HIV	prevalence	have	expressed	concern	regard - ing delayed cord clamping as part of management of the third stage of labour. These professionals are concerned	that	during	placental	separation 	a	partially	detached	placenta	could	be	exposed	to	maternal	 blood and this could lead to a micro-transfusion of maternal blood to the baby. It has been demonstrat - ed	that	the	potential	for	maternal-to-child	transmission	of	HIV	can	take	place	at	three	different	points	 in	time:	micro-transfusions	of	maternal	blood	to	the	fetus	during	pregnancy	(intra-uterine	HIV	transmis - sion) 	exposure	to	maternal	blood	and	vaginal	secretions	when	the	fetus	passes	through	the	birth	canal	 in	vaginal	deliveries	(intra-partum	transmission) 	and	during	breastfeeding	(postnatal	infection).	For	this	 reason 	the	main	intervention	to	reduce	the	maternal-to-child	transmission	is	the	reduction	of	mater - nal	viral	load	through	the	use	of	antiretroviral	drugs	during	pregnancy 	childbirth	and	postnatal	period.	 There is no evidence that delaying the cord clamping increases the possibility of HIV transmission from the mother to the newborn. Maternal blood percolates through the placental intervillous space through - out	pregnancy	with	a	relatively	low	risk	of	maternal	fetal	transmission	before	delivery.	It	is	highly	un - likely	that	separation	of	the	placenta	increases	exposure	to	maternal	blood 	and	is	highly	unlikely	that	 it	disrupts	the	fetal	placental	circulation	(i.e.	it	is	unlikely	that	during	placenta	separation	the	newborn	 circulation	is	exposed	to	maternal	blood).	 Thus 	the	proven	benefits	of	a	1	–	3	minute	delay	at	least	in	 clamping	the	cord	outweigh	the	theoretical 	and	unproven 	harms.	Late	cord	clamping	is	recommended	 even	among	women	living	with	HIV	or	women	with	unknown	HIV	status. •	There	is	a	lack	of	evidence	regarding	the	role	of	uterine	massage	for	PPH	prevention	when	no	uterotonic	 drugs	are	used 	or	if	a	uterotonic	drug	other	than	oxytocin	is	used.	 •	Although	the	GDG	acknowledged	that	one	small	study	reported	that	sustained	uterine	massage	and	clot	 expulsion	were	associated	with	a	reduction	in	the	use	of	additional	uterotonics 	there	is	lack	of	robust	 evidence	supporting	other	benefits.	However 	the	GDG	considered	that	routine	and	frequent	uterine	 tone	assessment	remains	a	crucial	part	of	immediate	postpartum	care 	particularly	for	the	optimization	 of early PPH diagnosis. •	Based	on	the	most	recent	evidence 	understanding	of	the	contribution	of	each	component	of	the	active	 management	of	the	third	stage	of	labour	package	has	evolved.	 The	GDG	considered	that	this	package	 has	a	primary	intervention:		the	use	of	an	uterotonic.	In	the	context	of	oxytocin	use 	CCT 	may	add	a	 small	benefit 	while	uterine	massage	may	add	no	benefit	for	the	prevention	of	PPH.	Early	cord	clamping	 is generally contraindicated.(Continued from previous page) ###24###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 18 Box 3: Recommendations for the prevention of PPH in caesarean sections 11.

Cord traction is the recommended method for the removal of the placenta in caesarean sec - tion.	(Strong	recommendation 	moderate-quality	evidence) Remarks •	The	GDG	noted	that 	in	terms	of	blood	loss 	there	was	not	enough	evidence	to	recommend	oxytocin	 infusion	over	IV	bolus	injection.	However 	due	to	concerns	regarding	adverse	haemodynamic	effects 	  the	GDG	considered	that	if	an	IV	bolus	injection	is	used 	a	slow	injection	rate	is	preferred	and	a	rapid	 injection rate should be avoided. •	The	GDG	noted	that	the	combination	of	an	oxytocin	infusion	after	an	initial	IV	bolus	of	oxytocin	after	 caesarean delivery reduces the need for additional uterotonic agents but does not affect the overall  occurrence of major obstetric haemorrhage. •	The GDG noted that carbetocin is associated with a reduction in the use of additional uterotonic agents but	with	no	difference	in	the	occurrence	of	major	obstetric	haemorrhage.	In	addition 	the	GDG	noted	 that	the	use	of	carbetocin	is	considerably	more	expensive	than	oxytocin.

It	encourages	health	care	 decision-makers	in	these	settings	to	strive	to	make	oxytocin	available. •	In	settings	where	IV	oxytocin	is	unavailable	to	women	who	have	received	prophylactic	IM	oxytocin	during	 the	third	stage	of	labour 	the	GDG	considered	misoprostol	to	be	a	valid	alternative. •	If	PPH	prophylaxis	with	misoprostol	has	been	administered	and	if	injectable	uterotonics	are	unavailable 	 there	is	insufficient	evidence	to	guide	further	misoprostol	dosing	and	consideration	must	be	given	to	the	 risk	of	potential	toxicity. •	There	is	no	added	benefit	to	offering	misoprostol	simultaneously	to	women	receiving	oxytocin	for	the	 treatment	of	PPH	(i.e.	adjunct	misoprostol). •	The	GDG	noted	that	the	two	largest	trials	of	misoprostol	for	the	treatment	of	PPH	(Winikoff	2010 	Blum	 2010)	reported	the	use	of	a	800 	μg	dose administered sublingually. The majority of the GDG members agreed that 800 	μg	is	an	acceptable	sublingual	misoprostol	 dose	for	the	treatment	of	PPH 	though	some	 members	of	the	GDG	expressed	concern	related	to	the	risk	of	hyperpyrexia	associated	with	this	dosage. •	If	IV	oxytocin	has	been	used	for	the	treatment	of	PPH	and	the	bleeding	does	not	stop 	there	is	a	paucity	 of data to recommend preferences for second line uterotonic drug treatment. Decisions in such situ - ations	must	be	guided	by	the	experience	of	the	provider 	the	availability	of	the	drugs 	and	by	known	 contraindications. •	In	situations	in	which	IM	oxytocin	can	be	administered	and	there	is	no	possibility	of	IV	treatment	with	 ergot	alkaloids/injectable	prostaglandins 	there	is	a	paucity	of	data	to	recommend	a	preference	of	IM	 oxytocin	over	misoprostol	or	other	uterotonics.	Decisions	in	such	situations	must	be	guided	by	the	expe - rience	of	the	provider 	the	availability	of	the	drugs 	and	by	known	contraindications. Box 5: Recommendations for the treatment of PPH – fluid resuscitation and tr anexamic acid 15. The use of isotonic crystalloids is recommended in preference to the use of colloids for the intravenous	fluid	resuscitation	of	women	with	PPH.	(Strong	recommendation 	low-quality	 evidence) 16.	The	use	of	tranexamic	acid	is	recommended	for	the	treatment	of	PPH	if	oxytocin	and	other	 uterotonics fail to stop the bleeding or if it is thought that the bleeding may be partly due to trauma.	(Weak	recommendation 	moderate-quality	evidence) Remarks •	Evidence	for	the	recommendation	of	tranexamic	acid	was	extrapolated	from	the	literature	on	surgery	 and	trauma 	which	shows	tranexamic	acid	to	be	a	safe	option	for	the	treatment	of	trauma-related	 bleeding. ###26###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 20 Box 6: Recommendations for the treatment of PPH – manoeuvres and other procedures 17. Uterine	massage	is	recommended	for	the	treatment	of	PPH.	(Strong	recommendation 	very- low-quality	evidence) 18. If	women	do	not	respond	to	treatment	using	uterotonics 	or	if	uterotonics	are	unavailable 	 the use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is recommended for the treatment of PPH due to uterine	atony.	(Weak	recommendation 	very-low-quality	evidence) 19. If	other	measures	have	failed	and	if	the	necessary	resources	are	available 	the	use	of	uter - ine	artery	embolization	is	recommended	as	a	treatment	for	PPH	due	to	uterine	atony.	(Weak	 recommendation 	very-low-quality	evidence) 20. If bleeding does not stop in spite of treatment using uterotonics and other available conserva - tive	interventions	(e.g.	uterine	massage 	balloon	tamponade) 	the	use	of	surgical	interven - tions	is	recommended.	(Strong	recommendation 	very-low-quality	evidence) 21. The use of bimanual uterine compression is recommended as a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal delivery.	(Weak	recommendation 	very-low-quality	evidence) 22. The	use	of	external	aortic	compression	for	the	treatment	of	PPH	due	to	uterine	atony	after	 vaginal birth is recommended as a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available. (Weak	recommendation 	very-low-quality	evidence) 23. The	use	of	non-pneumatic	anti-shock	garments	is	recommended	as	a	temporizing	measure	 until	appropriate	care	is	available.	(Weak	recommendation 	low-quality	evidence) 24. The	use	of	uterine	packing	is	not	recommended	for	the	treatment	of	PPH	due	to	uterine	 atony	after	vaginal	birth.	(Weak	recommendation 	very-low-quality	evidence) Remarks •	The GDG noted that the application of these interventions requires training and that maternal discom - fort and complications associated with these procedures have been reported. •	Uterine	massage	as	a	therapeutic	measure	is	defined	as	the	rubbing	of	the	uterus	achieved	through	the	 manual massaging of the abdomen. This is typically sustained until the bleeding stops or the uterus con - tracts. The GDP considered that uterine massage should be started once PPH has been diagnosed. •	The	initial	rubbing	of	the	uterus	and	expression	of	blood	clots	are	not	regarded	as	therapeutic	uterine	 massage. •	When	rating	the	recommendation	#17	as	‘strong’ 	the	low	cost	and	safety	of	uterine	massage	were	 taken	into	account. •	The use of balloon tamponade was considered by the GDG to be a measure that can potentially avoid surgery	or	as	a	temporizing	measure	while	awaiting	transfer	to	a	higher	level	facility.	 The	GDG	acknowl - edges	that	balloon	tamponade	can	be	obtained	with	specific	devices	as	well	as	with	lower	cost	adapta - tions 	including	those	based	on	the	use	of	condoms	and	surgical	gloves. •	The	GDG	noted	that	uterine	artery	embolization	requires	significant	resources 	in	terms	of	the	cost	of	 the	treatment 	the	facilities 	and	the	training	of	health	care	workers. •	The	GDG	noted	that	conservative	surgical	approaches	should	be	tried	first.	If	these	do	not	work 	they	 should	be	followed	by	more	invasive	procedures.	Compression	sutures 	for	example 	may	be	attempted	 as	a	first	intervention 	and	if	these	fail 	then	uterine 	utero-ovarian	and	hypogastric	vessel	ligation	may	 be	tried.	If	life-threatening	bleeding	continues	even	after	ligation 	then	a	subtotal	(otherwise	known	as	 supracervical)	or	total	hysterectomy	should	be	performed. •	The	GDG	acknowledged	that	the	level	of	health	care	provider	skills	will	play	a	role	in	the	selection	and	 sequence of the surgical interventions. (Continued on next page) ###27###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 21 •	External	aortic	compression	has	long	been	recommended	as	a	potential	life-saving	technique 	and	me - chanical	compression	of	the	aorta 	if	successful 	slows	blood	loss.	 The	GDG	placed	a	high	value	on	this	 procedure as a temporizing measure in the treatment of PPH. •	The	GDG	noted	that	research	evaluating	the	potential	benefits	and	harms	of	non-pneumatic	anti-shock	 garments	is	ongoing.	Based	on	the	evidence	available 	the	GDG	regarded	non-pneumatic	anti-shock	gar - ments as a temporizing measure while transfer is awaited. •	The	GDG	noted	that	there	was	no	evidence	of	benefit	of	uterine	packing	and	placed	a	high	value	on	 concerns regarding its potential harm. Box 7: Recommendations for the treatment of retained placenta 25. If	the	placenta	is	not	expelled	spontaneously 	the	use	of	additional	oxytocin	(10 IU 	IV/IM)	in	 combination	with	controlled	cord	traction	is	recommended.	(Weak	recommendation 	very- low-quality	evidence) 26.	The use of ergometrine for the management of a retained placenta is not recommended as this	may	cause	tetanic	uterine	contractions	which	may	delay	the	expulsion	of	the	placenta.	 (Weak	recommendation 	very-low-quality	evidence) 27. The	use	of	prostaglandin	E2	alpha	(dinoprostone	or	sulprostone)	in	the	management	of	re - tained	placenta	is	not	recommended.	(Weak	recommendation 	very-low-quality	evidence) 28. A	single	dose	of	antibiotics	(ampicillin	or	first-generation	cephalosporin)	is	recommended	if	 manual	removal	of	the	placenta	is	practised.	(Weak	recommendation 	very-low-quality	evi - dence) Remarks •	The GDG found no empirical evidence to support recommending the use of uterotonics for the manage - ment of a retained placenta in the absence of haemorrhage. The above recommendation was reached by consensus. •	The	WHO	guide 	“ Managing complications in pregnancy and childbirth ”	(WHO 	2007) 	states	that	if	a	 placenta	is	not	expelled	within	30	minutes	after	the	delivery	of	a	baby 	the	woman	should	be	diagnosed	 as	having	a	retained	placenta.	Since	there	is	no	evidence	for	or	against	this	definition 	the	delay	used	 before this condition is diagnosed is left to the judgement of the clinician. •	The	same	WHO	guide	also	suggests	that	in	the	absence	of	haemorrhage 	the	woman	should	be	observed	 for	a	further	30	minutes	after	the	initial	30	minutes 	before	the	manual	removal	of	the	placenta	is	at - tempted.	 The	GDG	noted	that	spontaneous	expulsion	of	the	placenta	can	still	occur 	even	in	the	absence	 of bleeding. A conservative approach is therefore advised and the timing of the manual removal of the placenta	as	a	definitive	treatment	is	left	to	the	judgement	of	the	clinician. •	The	recommendation	regarding	the	use	of	prostaglandin	E2	is	informed	by	a	lack	of	evidence	on	this	 question	and	also	by	concerns	related	to	adverse	events 	particularly	cardiac	events. •	Direct	evidence	of	the	value	of	antibiotic	prophylaxis	after	the	manual	removal	of	the	placenta	was	not	 available.	 The	GDG	considered	indirect	evidence	of	the	benefit	of	prophylactic	antibiotics	from	studies	 of	caesarean	section	and	abortion 	as	well	as	observational	studies	of	other	intrauterine	manipulations. •	Current	practice	suggests	that	ampicillin	or	first-generation	cephalosporins	may	be	administered	when	 the manual removal of the placenta is performed. •	This	question	was	identified	as	a	research	priority	for	settings	in	which	prophylactic	antibiotics	are	not	 routinely administered and those with low infectious morbidity. (Continued from previous page) ###28###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 22 Box 8: Health Systems and Organization of Care recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PPH 29. The use of formal protocols by health facilities for the prevention and treatment of PPH is recommended.	(Weak	recommendation 	moderate-quality	evidence) 30. The use of formal protocols for referral of women to a higher level of care is recommended for	health	facilities.	(Weak	recommendation 	very-low-quality	evidence) 31. The use of simulations of PPH treatment is recommended for pre-service and in-service train - ing	programmes.	(Weak	recommendation 	very-low-quality	evidence) 32. Monitoring the use of uterotonics after birth for the prevention of PPH is recommended as a	process	indicator	for	programmatic	evaluation.	(Weak	recommendation 	very-low-quality	 evidence) Remarks •	Routine	and	frequent	uterine	tone	assessment	remains	a	crucial	part	of	immediate	postpartum	care 	 particularly for optimizing the early diagnosis of PPH. •	The	GDG	acknowledged	that	the	implementation	of	formal	protocols	is	a	complex	process	which	will	 require the local adaptation of general guidelines. •	The	GDG	placed	a	high	value	on	the	costs	of	simulation	programmes	and	acknowledged	that	there	are	 different	types	of	simulation	programmes.	Some	programmes	are	hi-tech 	computerized	and	costly	while	 others	are	less	expensive	and	more	likely	to	be	affordable	in	low-	and	middle-income	countries.	 The	 GDG	identified	improvement	in	communication	between	health	care	providers	and	patients	and	their	 family members as an important priority in the training of health care providers in PPH management. •	The GDG recommended monitoring the use of prophylactic uterotonics. This recommendation is based on	experience	from	other	areas	of	health	care 	particularly	child	health 	where	content-based	health	 indicators are common and regarded as useful for programmatic purposes. The suggested indicator is calculated as the number of women receiving prophylactic uterotonic drugs after birth divided by all women giving birth. ###29###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 23 Box 9: Statements related to topics for which there is insufficient ev idence to issue a recom - mendation A.	 There	is	insufficient	evidence	to	recommend	one	oxytocin	route	over	another	for	the	prevention	of	PPH. B.	 There	is	insufficient	evidence	to	recommend	the	use	of	recombinant	factor	VIIa	for	the	treatment	of	 PPH. C.	 There	is	insufficient	evidence	to	recommend	the	use	of	intraumbilical	vein	injection	of	oxytocin	as	a	 treatment for retained placenta. D.	 There	is	insufficient	evidence	to	recommend	the	antenatal	distribution	of	misoprostol	to	pregnant	 women for self-administration for the prevention of PPH. E.	 There	is	insufficient	evidence	to	recommend	the	measurement	of	blood	loss	over	clinical	estimation	of	 blood loss. Remarks •	The	GDG	noted	that	there	are	three	ongoing	trials	in	which	the	IV	and	IM	routes	for	oxytocin	administra - tion are being compared for the prevention of PPH. •	The	GDG	considered	there	to	be	insufficient	evidence	to	recommend	the	use	of	oxytocin	infusion	over	 IV	bolus	injection	with	regard	to	blood	loss.	However 	in	light	of	concerns	about	the	potential	adverse	 haemodynamic	effects 	the	GDG	considered	that	if	IV	bolus	injection	treatment	is	to	be	used	then	a	 slow injection rate is preferred and a rapid injection rate should be avoided. •	In	the	context	of	PPH 	the	GDP 	considered	that	the	use	of	recombinant	factor	VIIa	should	be	limited	to	 women	with	specific	haematological	indications.	 The	group	regarded	the	recombinant	factor	VIIa	as	a	 potentially	life-saving	drug 	but	noted	that	it	is	also	associated	with	life-threatening	side-effects.	More - over 	recombinant	factor	VIIa	is	expensive	and	may	be	difficult	to	administer. •	The	GDG	acknowledged	that	while	there	is	a	paucity	of	data	to	recommend	intraumbilical	vein	injec - tion	of	oxytocin	as	a	treatment	for	retained	placenta 	the	procedure	itself	has	not	been	shown	to	cause	 harm	and	demonstrates	a	non-significant	trend	towards	a	lower	risk	of	requiring	the	manual	removal	of	 the placenta. •	The	GDG	acknowledged	that	a	number	of	countries	have	embarked	on	community-level	programmes	of	 misoprostol	distribution	and	considered	that	this	should	be	done	in	the	context	of	research	(where	reli - able	data	on	coverage 	safety	and	health	outcomes	can	be	collected). •	The GDG noted that all trials included in the systematic review on the measurement of blood loss were conducted in developed countries and views the applicability of this evidence to low- and middle- income countries as very uncertain. ###30###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 24 4. Research implications The	GDG	identified	important	knowledge	gaps	that	need	to	be	addressed	through	 primary	research.	In	this	guideline 	recommendations	based	on	evidence	quality	that	 was	rated	as	‘very	low’ 	or	‘low’ 	require	further	research.	Conversely 	further	re - search	is	not	a	priority	for	those	recommendations	based	on	evidence	of	‘moderate’ 	 or	‘high’ 	quality.	Knowledge	gaps	identified	in	the	2007	and	2009	WHO	documents	 were	also	reviewed.	 The	identified	knowledge	gaps	were	prioritized	by	considering	 whether	such	research	would	be	feasible 	innovative 	original 	likely	to	promote	 equity 	and	contribute	to	the	reduction	of	the	burden	of	PPH.	 The	main	barriers	to	 scaling	up	the	intervention	were	also	considered	in	this	prioritization	exercise. The GDG noted that research is either planned or ongoing for some of the research priorities	identified.	However 	there	is	no	certainty	that	these	investigations	will	 provide	conclusive	results 	and	the	topics	have	therefore	remained	listed	as	re - search priorities in this document. Key research priority In	settings	where	the	use	of	injectable	uterotonics	is	not	feasible 	what	are	the	ef - fects of antenatal distribution of misoprostol to pregnant women for self-administra - tion during the third stage of labour? Other research questions •	What	is	the	minimum	effective	dose	of	oxytocin	for	the	prevention	of	PPH?	 •	What	are	the	effects	of	IM	oxytocin	(versus	IV	oxytocin)	for	the	prevention	of	 PPH? •	Can	oxytocin	be	administered	safely	by	unskilled	attendants? •	What	are	the	effects	of	buccal	and	sublingual	use	of	oxytocin	for	the	prevention	 of PPH? •	What is the minimum effective dose of misoprostol for the prevention of PPH? •	What is the minimum effective dose of misoprostol for the treatment of PPH? •	What	are	effects	and	safety	of	misoprostol	as	treatment	for	PPH 	in	women	who	 received	misoprostol	as	PPH	prophylaxis?	 •	Should	misoprostol	be	used	in	addition	to	oxytocin	for	PPH	prevention? •	What	are	the	effects	of	tranexamic	acid	in	PPH	treatment? •	What are the effects of uterine massage for the prevention of PPH? •	What	are	the	effects	of	uterine	massage	to	prevent	PPH 	where	oxytocin	is	not	 available? •	What are the effects of uterine balloon or tamponade in the treatment of PPH? •	What	are	the	effects	of	uterine	massage	to	prevent	PPH 	where	only	misoprostol	 is available? ###31###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 25 •	What	are	the	effects	of	prophylactic	antibiotics	after	manual	extraction	of	the	 placenta as part of the treatment of retained placenta? •	What are the effects of the use of misoprostol for the treatment of retained placenta? •	What	are	effects	of	ergometrine	(in	combination	or	not	with	oxytocin)	after	 caesarean section for the prevention of PPH? •	What	is	the	optimal	time	for	cord	clamping	in	the	context	of	physiologic	and	ac - tive management of third stage of labour? •	What	is	the	appropriate	time	to	administer	oxytocin	for	PPH	prevention 	rela - tive	to	cord	clamping	and	placental	delivery?

Dissemination and implementation of the guideline The ultimate goal of this guideline is to improve the quality of care and health outcomes related to PPH. Therefore the dissemination and implementation of this guideline	are	crucial	steps	that	should	be	undertaken	by	the	international	commu - nity and local health care services. The WHO Department of Reproductive Health and	Research	has	adopted	a	formal	knowledge-to-action	framework	for	the	dissemi - nation 	adaptation	and	implementation	of	guidelines	(8).	In	addition	to	this	frame - work 	a	list	of	priority	actions	was	established	during	the	WHO	 Technical	Consulta - tion which will be used by the WHO and other partners to foster the dissemination and	implementation	of	this	guideline	(EB	Box	2). Guideline dissemination and evaluation The recommendations in this guideline will be disseminated through a broad net - work	of	international	partners 	including	WHO	country	and	regional	offices 	min - istries	of	health 	WHO	collaborating	centres 	other	United	Nations	agencies 	and	 non-governmental organizations. They will also be published on the WHO website and	in	The	WHO	Reproductive	Health	Library	(11) 	where	they	will	be	accompanied	 by an independent critical appraisal based on the AGREE instrument (Appraisal of Guidelines	Research	and	Evaluation)	which	can	be	found	at	http://www.agreecol - laboration.org/instrument.	 A	policy	brief	will	also	be	developed	for	a	wide	range	of	 policy-makers 	programme	managers	and	clinicians 	and	then	disseminated	through	 WHO	country	offices. Guideline implementation The successful introduction of evidence-based policies related to the prevention and management of PPH into national programmes and health care services depends on well-planned and participatory consensus-driven processes of adaptation and imple - ###32###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 26 mentation.	 These	processes	may	include	the	development	or	revision	of	existing	 national guidelines or protocols based on this document. The recommendations contained in the present guideline should be adapted into locally-appropriate	documents	that	are	able	to	meet	the	specific	needs	of	each	 country	and	health	service.	Modifications	to	the	recommendations 	where	necessary 	 should	be	limited	to	weak	recommendations	and	justifications	for	any	changes	made	 in	an	explicit	and	transparent	manner.	 An enabling environment should be created for the use of these recommendations (for	example 	by	widening	the	availability	of	uterotonics) 	including	changes	in	the	 behaviour of health care practitioners to enable the use of evidence-based practic - es. Local professional societies may play important roles in this process and an all- inclusive	and	participatory	process	should	be	encouraged.	 The	WHO’s	Department	of	 Reproductive	Health	and	Research	has	published	specific	guidance	on	the	introduc - tion	of	the	WHO’s	reproductive	health	guidelines	and	tools	in	national	programmes. 6. Applicability issues Anticipated impact on the organization of care and  resources The evidence-based prevention and management of PPH can be achieved with the use	of	relatively	inexpensive	drugs.	However 	the	GDG	noted	that	the	following	is - sues should be considered before the recommendations made in this current guide - line	are	applied: •	Women	should	not	be	left	alone	during	the	first	hours	after	delivery	of	the	baby	 and the placenta •	In	settings	where	oxytocin	is	used 	attention	should	be	paid	to	the	oxytocin	cold	 chain	(i.e.	the	requirements	of	a	temperature-controlled	supply	chain) •	Health services adopting late cord clamping should also adopt strategies to iden - tify	(and	if	necessary	to	treat)	neonatal	jaundice Monitoring and evaluating the guideline implementation The implementation of the recommendations in this guideline should be monitored at	the	health-service	level.	Interrupted	time	series 	clinical	audits	or	criterion-based	 clinical audits could be used to obtain relevant data related to the management of PPH.	Clearly-defined	review	criteria	and	indicators	are	needed	and	these	could	be	 associated with locally-agreed targets. The GDG strongly recommends that the cov - erage of prophylactic uterotonics be used as a process indicator for the monitoring and prevention of PPH. •	Prophylactic	Uterotonic	Coverage	Indicator:	 The	suggested	indicator	is	calculat - ed as the number of women receiving prophylactic uterotonics during the third stage of labour divided by all women giving birth This	indicator	provides	an	overall	assessment	of	adherence	to	a	key	recommendation	 included	in	this	guideline.	 The	use	of	other	locally-agreed	and	more	specific	indica - ###33###WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 27 tors	(e.g.	the	assessment	of	the	use	of	specific	uterotonics)	may	be	necessary	to	 obtain a more complete assessment of the quality of care related to the prevention and	treatment	of	PPH.	WHO	has	developed	specific	guidance	for	evaluating	the	qual - ity	of	care	for	severe	maternal	complications	(including	PPH)	based	on	the	near-miss	 and	criterion-based	clinical	audit	concepts	(13). 7. Updating the guideline This	guideline	will	be	updated	in	2017	or	following	the	identification	of	new	evi - dence that indicates a need to revise these recommendations.

Template	for	the	summary	of	considerations	related	to	the	strength	of	the	recommendations	with	explanations	for	completing	the	template	 Recommendation Which recommendation? Intervention What is the intervention? Quality	of	the	 evidence High  Moderate  Low  Very lowThe	higher	the	quality	of	the	evidence 	the	stronger	the	recommendation. If	the	evidence	quality	is	‘low’ 	or	‘very	low’ 	consider	more	carefully	the	other	criteria	below	in	deciding	the	strength	of	the	 recommendation. Values and preferences	No	significant	variability 	Significant	variabilityThis	refers	to	values	placed	by	health	workers 	policy-makers 	patients	and	other	stakeholders	on	the	intended	outcomes	of	 the interventions. If	there	is	wide	variability	between	the	values	and	preferences	of	various	stakeholders 	the	intervention	is	less	likely	to	have	a	 strong recommendation. Magnitude of effect in critical outcomes Large effect (RR>2 or RR<0.5) 	Small	effect	(0.5<RR<2)This refers to the potential of the intervention to have large effects. The effects can be enhanced by being combined with other	interventions.	Consider	which	potential	associations	(or	‘bundles’)	can	enhance	effects. The	larger	the	potential	effects	and	the	longer	the	time	period	of	the	potential	effects 	the	more	likely	the	intervention	is	to	 have a strong recommendation. Balance of benefits	versus	 disadvantages	Benefits	outweigh	 disadvantages 	Benefits	and	 disadvantages are balanced  Disadvantages outweigh benefitsBenefits	refer	to	the	intended	positive	effects	of	an	intervention	. Disadvantages refer to the potentially negative effects of an intervention as well as its unintended effects. The	fewer	the	potentially	negative	effects	there	are 	the	more	likely	the	intervention	is	to	receive	a	strong	recommendation. Resource use  Less resource intensive  More resource intensiveThe	resources	needed	for	the	implementation	of	a	recommendation	may	include	financial	resources 	human	resources 	 and	infrastructure	or	equipment.	Ideally 	the	cost	of	the	benefits	of	an	intervention	should	be	reasonable 	affordable	and	 sustainable.	It	should	be	remembered	that	capital	costs 	such	as	those	required	for	infrastructural	development 	may	be	 initially	high	but	may	also	yield	long-term	benefits.	 Generally 	interventions	that	incur	higher	incremental	or	recurrent	costs	are	less	likely	to	be	strongly	recommended. Feasibility 	Yes 	globally 	Yes 	conditionallyPolitical	commitment	and	wide	stakeholder	engagement	are	prerequisites	for	interventions.	 The	‘technical’ 	feasibility	of	 interventions	also	depends	on	sufficiently	functional	organizational	and	institutional	structures	to	manage 	follow	through 	 and monitor the implementation of the recommendation. The elements of technical feasibility vary considerably by country and	by	context;	where	these	elements	are	likely	to	be	functional	across	a	wide	variety	of	settings	it	is	more	likely	that	 interventions will receive strong recommendations. Recommendation direction In favour of the intervention  Against the intervention Overall	ranking  Strong recommendation 	Weak	recommendationStrength of the recommendation. ###48###  WHO recommendations for the prevention  and treatment of  postpartum haemorrhage For more information please contact: Department of Reproductive Health and Research  E-mail: reproductivehealth@who.int  www.who.int/reproductivehealth Maternal Newborn Child and Adolescent Health E-mail: mncah@who.int www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent World Health Organization  Avenue Appia 20 CH-1211 Geneva 27  Switzerland
