They are based on the FIGO SafeMotherhood and Newborn Health Committee (SMNH) guidelines that were published in 20121 and include research and consensus guide- lines. For the present document a bibliographic review was performed and studies from LMICs and across regions were identified usingthe search engines PubMed Medline Embase Science Direct and Google Scholar. According to the GRADE (Grading of RecommendationsAssessment Development and Evaluation) approach this update does not generate a universal level of evidence. However each section andthe generated conclusions and recommendations use the degrees of evidence that were identified in the bibliographic review. REFERENCE 1. Lalonde A.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE The purpose of this document is to update key concepts in the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and give clear and precise tools to health personnel in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) to perform evidence- based treatments with the aim of reducing related maternal morbidity and mortality. TARGET AUDIENCE Gynecologists obstetricians midwives nurses general practitioners and other health personnel in charge of the care of pregnant women with PPH. Keywords: FIGO recommendations management postpartum hemorrhage PPH PPH prevention PPH treatment Disclaimer These FIGO recommendations are not intended to be a sole source of guidance or prescriptive protocol in managing PPH. They are designed to assist stakeholders by providing an evidence- based framework for decision- making in a PPH setting. The clinical judgment of the doctor or other practitioner in the context of the clinical presentation of the patient and the available resources for diagnosis and treatment should always inform the choice of clinical procedure and treatment plan. |  5 ESCOBAR Et Al.

Implementation of the FIGO recommendations by health systems and national societies for the management of postpartum hemorrhage 50Members of the FIGO Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee 2018– 2021 50 |  7 ESCOBAR Et Al. 1  |  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) is actively contributing to the global effort to reduce maternal death and disability around the world. Its mission statement re-flects a commitment to promoting health human rights and well- being of all women especially those at the most significant risk of death and disability associated with childbearing. FIGO providesevidence- based interventions that can reduce the incidence of maternal morbidity and mortality when applied with informed consent. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) continues to be the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in most countries around the world. Despite multiple collaborative efforts at alllevels there is still a lack of implementation or adherence to the recommendations for management of PPH when faced with this obstetric emergency. In part this delay in implementationlies in the lack of information from current evidence and a lack of unification of the multiple guidelines for diagnosis and strat- egies to control bleeding. To provide clear and practical toolsto approach this obstetric emergency especially for low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) the FIGO Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee (SMNH) supported by a group of experts worldwide developed this updated review. It aims toprovide multiple alternatives for the diagnosis and management of PPH tailored to the resources available at the institutional  local or regional level. This document reflects the best availableevidence drawn from scientific literature and expert opinion on the prevention and treatment of PPH in low- resource settings. FIGO believes that the greatest impediment in the adoption of a given strategy is the absence of an effective implementation tool. 8 |    ESCOBAR Et Al. 2  |  FIGO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE Health workers at all levels of care (particularly in LMICs) need to have access to appropriate medications1 and training in PPH prevention and management procedures. All attempts should bemade to reduce PPH using cost- effective resource- appropriate interventions. At first all should be done to avoid PPH and re-duce the need for expensive lifesaving surgical interventions.,"(51.630218505859375, 204.99502563476562, 290.4376525878906, 177.7041778564453)","(3, 6)",1442
3,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Theroutine use of active management of the third stage of labor by all attendants regardless of where they practice should be rec- ommended.2 All birth attendants must know how to provide safe care (physiologic management) to prevent PPH in the absence of uterotonic drugs.3 2.1  |  FIGO recommendations for prevention of postpartum hemorrhage 1. The use of uterotonics for prevention of PPH during the thirdstage of labor is recommended for all births.4 5 Oxytocin (10 IU intravenously/intramuscularly [IV/IM]) is recommended for the prevention of PPH for vaginal delivery and cesarean section.4 5 In settings where oxytocin is used attention should be paid to the oxytocin cold chain.6 2. In settings where oxytocin is unavailable or its quality can-not be guaranteed the use of other injectable uterotonics (if appropriate ergometrine/methylergometrine 200 μg IM/IV  hypertensive disorders can be safely excluded prior to its use) or oral misoprostol (400–600 µg orally) or carbetocin 100 µg IM/IV is recommended for the prevention of PPH.4 5 3. The combinations of ergometrine plus oxytocin or misoprostol plusoxytocin may be more effective uterotonic drug strategies for the prevention of PPH ≥500 ml compared with the current standard  oxytocin. This comes at the expense of a higher risk of adverse ef-fects (vomiting and hypertension with ergometrine and fever with misoprostol).7 4. In settings where skilled birth attendants are not present to ad-minister injectable uterotonics and oxytocin is unavailable the administration of misoprostol (400– 600 μg orally) by community healthcare workers and lay health workers is recommended for the prevention of PPH.4 5 5. In settings where skilled birth attendants are unavailable con-trolled cord traction (CCT) is not recommended.4 6. Sustained uterine massage is not recommended as an interven-tion to prevent PPH in women who have received prophylactic oxytocin.8 7. Postpartum abdominal uterine tonus assessment for early identi-fication of uterine atony is recommended for all women.4 8. Oxytocin (IV or IM) and CCT is the recommended method for removalof the placenta for the prevention of PPH in cesarean delivery.4 2.2  |  FIGO recommendations for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage 1. Intravenous oxytocin alone is the recommended first- lineuterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH.3 4 2. If intravenous oxytocin is unavailable or if the bleedingdoes not respond to oxytocin the use of intramuscular er- gometrine oxytocin– ergometrine fixed dose or a prosta- glandin drug (including sublingual misoprostol 800 μg) is recommended.3 4 9 10 3. There is no evidence about the safety and efficacy of an additional800- μg dose of misoprostol for treatment of PPH when given to women who have already received 600 μg of prophylactic misopros- tol orally. 4. The use of isotonic crystalloids is recommended in preference tothe use of colloids for the initial intravenous fluid resuscitation of women with PPH.4 11 5. Early use of intravenous tranexamic acid as soon as PPH is diag-nosed but within 3 h of birth in addition to standard care is rec- ommended for women with clinically diagnosed PPH following vaginal birth or cesarean delivery.12– 14 6. Administration of 1 g (100 mg/ml) tranexamic acid intravenously at1 ml/min (i.e. administered over 10 min) with a second dose of 1 g in-travenously if bleeding continues after 30 min or if bleeding restarts within 24 h of completing the first dose. Reducing maternal deathsdue to bleeding through scaling up of tranexamic acid for PPH treat- ment could have a positive impact on health equity and improve out- comes among disadvantaged women especially in LMICs.15 7. Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH.3 48. The use of bimanual uterine compression or external aorticcompression for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth is recommended as a temporizing measure until ap- propriate care is available.3 4 9. If women do not respond to treatment using uterotonics orif uterotonics are unavailable the use of uterine balloon tam- ponade is recommended as an effective nonsurgical technique that can potentially improve survival in women with PPH due to uterine atony after ruling out retained products of conception or uterine rupture as a contributing factor.3 4 16 10. Use of the nonpneumatic antishock garment is recommendedas a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available.3 4 11. The use of uterine packing is not recommended for the treat-ment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth.3 4 12. Uterine artery embolization can be another conservative man-agement measure for PPH if technical conditions and skilled human resources are available for its use.17 13. If bleeding does not stop despite treatment using uterotonicsand other available conservative interventions (e.g. uterine mas-sage balloon tamponade) the use of surgical interventions is recommended.3 4 Surgical interventions include the use of com- pression suture techniques 18 uterine and hypogastric artery li- gation and hysterectomy. |  9 ESCOBAR Et Al. 14. The priority is to stop the bleeding before the patient developscoagulation problems and organ damage from under- perfusion. Conservative approaches should be tried first rapidly moving to more invasive procedures if these do not work. REFERENCES 1. World Health Organization. WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.

This document willupdate the recommendations and discuss new approaches. 3.3  |  Definition of postpartum hemorrhage The lack of consistency in the definition of PPH has been a major limitation to the ability to compare prevalence in different stud- ies (Table 2). Classically it was defined as quantified bleeding ofmore than 500 ml for vaginal deliveries and more than 1000 ml for cesarean deliveries occurring within the first 24 h of delivery.1 However this definition did not focus on clinical signs and symp- toms of hemorrhage and thus prevented early detection in many cases. Therefore in 2017 the American College of Obstetriciansand Gynecologists (ACOG) changed the definition to blood loss of more than or equal to 1000 ml or blood loss that was accompanied by signs or symptoms of hypovolemia occurring within 24 h after birth regardless of the mode of delivery.6 In contrast the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) defines PPH according to the volume of blood lost: minor (between 500 and 1000 ml) and major (>1000 ml).7 However the volume of estimated blood loss remains unreliable in many cases and therefore much attention should be directed to the general clinical status of the patient instead.8 Several tools for assessment of blood loss have been used as accurate estimation will directly influence the diag- nosis and management of PPH.,"(45.622802734375, 231.59768676757812, 551.6726684570312, 242.7041778564453)","(7, 8)",1367
5,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Many groups cite visual estimationas part of blood loss assessment but as it has high potential to un- derestimate hemorrhage use of additional tools for more objective estimation such as gravimetric measurement direct blood collec- tion techniques and evaluation of clinical parameters have been proposed.9– 17 Recently some guidelines have incorporated the shock index9 11 14 17 and obstetric early warning systems into their recommendations to evaluate bleeding.11 14 17 3.4  |  Etiologies/risk factors While there exist several identifiable risk factors for PPH most cases occur unexpectedly.6 18 An easy way to remember the most common etiologies is to remember the four T’s19: TA B LE 1 FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage FIGO recommendation Year References Management of the third stage of labor to prevent post- partum hemorrhage 2003 International Confederation of Midwives International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians.

Thrombin: coagulopathy. Uterine atony can be anticipated after prolonged labor partic- ularly with the use of oxytocin in pregnancies complicated with chorioamnionitis high parity general anesthesia and other factors that lead to uterine overdistension such as multiple fetal gesta- tion polyhydramnios and fetal macrosomia.6 20 Trauma accounts for 15%– 20% of cases 21 and is mostly attributed to perineal or cervical lacerations perineal hematomas episiotomies or uterine rupture.6 20 These occur in the setting of precipitous uncontrolled deliveries or operative vaginal deliveries.6 Retained products of conception can increase the risk of PPH by 3.5 times.22 Risk fac- tors include succenturiate placenta and previous instrumenta- tion.6 Coagulation problems can be divided into inherited such as von Willebrand diseases hemophilia and idiopathic thrombo- cytopenic purpura and acquired such as the use of anticoagu- lant therapy20 and the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy after placental abruption pre- eclampsia with severe features intrauterine fetal demise sepsis or amniotic fluid embo- lism.6 20 23 Other etiologies include uterine inversion and abnormal placentation.

These initiatives that involve multiple intervention points and actors have been called “bundles” or intervention packages which consist of the implementation of a group of interventions as well as multi- disciplinary programs that standardize and comprehensively address the management of pathologies.1– 6 Bundles represent a selection of existing guidelines and recommendations in a form that aids system- atic implementation and a consistency of practice. The California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) Working Group on obstetrical hemorrhage developed the Improving the Health Care Response to Obstetric Bleeding Toolkit in 2010 to help obstetric providers clinical staff hospitals and healthcare organizations develop methods within their facility for timely rec- ognition and an organized and rapid response to bleeding.,"(306.81939697265625, 419.7402038574219, 551.6839599609375, 73.70418548583984)","(9, 11)",1453
7,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,In March2015 version 2.0 was updated with the latest evidence- based changes.6 In 2015 work groups of the National Partnership for Maternal Safety — within the Council on Patient Safety in Women's Health Care that represents all major women's healthcare professional or- ganizations in the USA — developed an obstetric hemorrhage safety bundle. The goal of the partnership was the adoption of the safetybundle by every birthing facility. This consensus bundle is organizedinto four action domains: readiness recognition and prevention re- sponse and reporting and systems learning. There are 13 key ele-ments within these four action domains (Table 3). In 2017 the World Health Organization (WHO) carried out a technical consultation among international maternal health experts to evaluate the development of care bundles for PPH. A total of 730TA B LE 3 Obstetric hemorrhage safety bundle action domains from the National Partnership for Maternal Safety Council on Patient Safety in Women's Healtha Domain Key elements Readiness (Every Unit) 1.

TA B LE 4 Final care bundles for postpartum hemorrhagea PPH care bundle Components First response PPH bundle Uterotonic drugs Isotonic crystalloids Tranexamic acid Uterine massage Notes: Initial fluid resuscitation is performed together with intravenous (IV) administration of uterotonics. If IV uterotonics are not available fluid resuscitation should be started in parallel with sublingual misoprostol or other parenteral uterotonics. If PPH is in the context of placental retention the placenta should be extracted and a single dose of antibiotics should be administered. If lacerations are encountered they should be repaired. Response to refractory PPH bundle Compressive measures (aortic compression or bimanual uterine compression) Intrauterine balloon tamponade Non- pneumatic antishock garment Notes: A continuing dose of uterotonics (e.g. oxytocin diluted in isotonic crystalloids) and a second dose of tranexamic acid should be administered during the application of this bundle. aReproduced from Althabe et al.8 14 |    ESCOBAR Et Al. articles were reviewed and 430 were used for the construction of the theoretical framework of the process. The consultation led toa definition of two care bundles which are summarized in Table 4. The first response PPH bundle must be implemented at both the primary healthcare and hospital levels. The discussion about the re-sponse to refractory PPH bundle raised some controversy. For thefirst response PPH bundle the next phase is the development of an implementation strategy culminating in a model for use at the facility level in LMICs. For the response to refractory PPH bundle itis a priority to solve pending controversies including the operational definition of refractory PPH and to better understand the effective- ness of various uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) devices.

8,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Insufficient blood flow may be clinically identified as the develop- ment of one or more of the following: lactic acidosis altered men- tal status oliguria and tachycardia. Vital signs monitoring is keyto hemodynamic assessment and prompt intervention.1 In healthy pregnant and postpartum women cardiologic physiologic com- pensatory mechanisms prevent changes in vital signs until a large volume of blood has been lost (usually >1000 ml). Hence changesin clinical and vital signs that result from hemorrhage appear late in the process and may not lead to early identification of PPH. This in turn makes it difficult to establish cutoff points to trigger clinical interventions. Moreover because traditional vital signschange late and are less reliable as triggers for clinical actions  other indicators could help to characterize maternal hypovolemia caused by bleeding.2 Although the use of conventional individual vital signs (pulse and systolic blood pressure) may lack accuracy in the assessment of hypotension a simple combination of both may transform routine clinical parameters into a more accurate indica- tor of hypovolemia such as the shock index (SI). SI is defined asthe ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure.3 4 The SI may im- prove the predictive capability of individual clinical signs which aids early identification of women at risk of hypovolemia as the result of obstetric causes.5 Moreover the SI has been proposed as a reliable indicator of adverse maternal outcomes 6 and its val- ues have been set to indicate clinical management.7 However the association between shock parameters and advanced treatment modalities in severe PPH has yet to be reported. 5.1  |  Assessment of circulating blood volume in postpartum hemorrhage The essential cornerstone of management of PPH involves prompt diagnosis and rapid replacement of lost blood volume as well as the oxygen- carrying capacity of blood accompanied by immediate medical and surgical measures to address the underlying cause(s)  and hence prevent more loss. To assess the patient's condition SIhas been introduced as a simple and clinically effective vital sign. The SI has been shown to have an inverse linear relation- ship with left ventricular stroke work in acute circulatory failure. Therefore a concurrent reduction of left ventricular stroke work (induced by hemorrhage trauma or sepsis) was associated with an elevation of the SI and a deterioration in left ventricular mechanical performance. Poor left ventricular function or persistent abnormalelevation of the SI after aggressive therapy and hemodynamic sta- bilization was associated with increased mortality in critically ill  traumatized patients.8 In obstetric and nonobstetric circumstances  the absence of a significant drop in blood pressure in patients with PPH may mask the actual hypovolemic status due to physiological compensatory mechanisms.9 For that reason the SI was the only promising marker that indicated the severity of blood loss.2 5 The SI together with the rule of 30 are important tools that may aid clinicians in an emergency to determine the amount of blood loss and the degree of hemodynamic instability. Before the fall in systolicblood pressure heart rate rises to compensate for the blood loss  and thus the SI increases. The rule of 30 is an approximated bloodloss of 30% of normal (70 ml/kg in adults 100 ml/kg throughout pregnancy) defined by a fall of 30% in hematocrit a fall of 30% in hemoglobin (approximately 3 g/dl) a fall of 30 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and a rise in pulse rate by 30 beats per minute.10 It has been shown that an SI ≥0.9 is associated with increased mortal- ity and an SI>1 increases the likelihood of blood transfusion.11 12 To date standard obstetric SI has been defined as 0.7– 0.9 compared with 0.5– 0.7 for the nonpregnant population taking into account that the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy may delay the recogni- tion of hypovolemia.5 If intravascular volume depletion is suspected  a rapid clinical assessment is required because the patient's clinical condition can deteriorate leading to the development of hemor- rhagic shock rapidly. Proper medical record- taking skills may high-light symptoms associated with shock such as pain and overt blood loss as well as general malaise anxiety and dyspnea. Notably in set-tings where few PPH treatment options exist and in cases of home deliveries diagnosis and treatment or referral must occur even ear- lier than in hospital settings to improve outcomes. For that reasonSI may be a valuable threshold in LMICs where mortality is highest and is often related to delays in complication recognition transpor- tation and level of care at the facility.2 A threshold of SI ≥0.9 should be tested to alert community healthcare providers of the need for urgent transfer.13 REFERENCES 1.

PPH guidelines usually address similar topics (e.g. di-agnosis prevention and treatment of PPH) but may differ in their recommendations.2– 4 These differences are because most of the recommendations are based on observational studies clinical judgment and expert opinion. There are few randomized con-trolled trials available to produce strong recommendations for the management of PPH due to the emergency of the condition that hinders this type of study. In the absence of randomized trialsguidelines gather the best available evidence. In addition popula-tion characteristics cultural aspects resources availability as well as frequency and timing of updates may influence the guidelines’ contents and justify some disparities.1– 4 REFERENCES 1.

Oxytocin has been cited as the drug of choice by most guidelines  but its dosages and route of administration vary largely especially when considering mode of delivery.1– 5 7– 10 In 2012 FIGO established recommendations for the prevention of PPH11 and in 2018 WHO updated its recommendation for pharmacological PPH prevention and reinforced the use of oxytocin (10 IU intramuscularly or intra- venously) as the drug of choice.12 WHO also recommends the use of carbetocin (if cost- effective) ergot alkaloids (alone or combined if there are no contraindications) or oral misoprostol in settings where oxytocin is not available or its quality cannot be guaranteed. Misoprostol is also recommended when the use of other injectable uterotonics is not possible due to unavailability or contraindication to use such as hypertension in the context of ergometrine.12 13 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) has updated its publication and reinforced the use of carbetocin as a first- line uterotonic for prevention at cesarean delivery or vaginal delivery with one risk factor.6 The German/Austrian/Swiss guideline mentions that prophylaxis during cesarean delivery can consist of administering either oxytocin or carbetocin.5 Other prophylactic strategies have been proposed in guidelines but many had no great consensus or no clear benefits.1– 7 Table 5 summarizes various PPH prevention strategies described by different societies worldwide.

Postpartum hemorrhage care bundles to improve adherence to guidelines: A WHO technical consultation. Int J Gynecol Obstet. 2020 148:290– 299. 6.2  |  Guidelines that address the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage PPH guidelines frequently recommend a multidisciplinary approach for reaching effective early control of bleeding. Treatment should bedirected to the specific cause of PPH (uterine atony genital trauma  retained placenta and/or coagulopathy) and therapeutic steps should move from the less invasive method to the more complex and radical approach. A set of initial measures also seems to be consen-sual in most guidelines and consist of maintenance of two large IV lines supplementation of oxygen strict monitoring of women crys- talloids infusion and measures to avoid hypothermia and evaluate the PPH cause.1– 9 If atony is the etiology most guidelines suggest perform- ing temporary mechanical measures such as uterine massage or uterine bimanual compression with concurrent pharmaco- logical treatment.1– 10 Uterotonics are considered the first- line treatment for uterine atony. Intravenous oxytocin is usually thepreferred drug and route of administration but its dosage varies widely. When oxytocin fails to control PPH guidelines recom-mend the use of an additional drug such as ergot alkaloids in- jectable prostaglandins or misoprostol.1– 4 6– 8 10 SOGC mentions carbetocin as a uterotonic available for treatment 5 and the German/Austrian/Swiss guidelines highlight that the use of car- betocin to treat PPH is currently not sufficiently investigated4 (Table 6). Since publication of the World Maternal Antifibrolytic (WOMAN) trial 11 tranexamic acid (TXA) an antifibrinolytic drug has been in- corporated into PPH guidelines around the world.4 6– 10 12 13 WHO has updated this topic and recommends the use of TXA as soon as possible within the first 3 h from birth at a dose of 1 g intravenously  regardless of the route of birth.12 13 However some guidelines do not cite it5 or do not add it in a definitive manner because their last update occurred before the WOMAN trial results.1 2 Another drug that has been discussed in many guidelines is recombinant activated factor VII for massive PPH however there is no consensus about its use.1– 6 When pharmacological treatment fails in controlling hemor- rhage guidelines usually recommend some mechanical radiologi- cal and more conservative surgical approaches before performing hysterectomy. The available guidelines are summarized in Table 6. The most cited ones are uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) uterine compressive sutures (UCS) pelvic vascular ligation (PVL) and embo- lization.1– 7 10 Uterine packing with gauze is also mentioned in some guidelines but its use is controversial.3 5 ACOG mentions the use of a gauze soaked with thrombin.6 German/Austrian/Swiss guidelines cite the use of intrauter- ine packing with a gauze coated with a hemostatic agent.4 Due to the lack of evidence guidelines do not necessarily recommend these conservative approaches in a well- defined step- wise pro- gression and their utilization depends mainly on the availability of resources professional familiarity with technique and clinical circumstances.10 UBT is typically indicated as the treatment of choice when uter- ine atony is refractory to uterotonics after vaginal delivery as it is less invasive than the other procedures.1– 3 6– 9 This should be con- sidered after ruling out retained products of conception ruptured uterus or vaginal or cervical laceration as a contributing factor. IfUBT fails to control bleeding in these cases invasive treatments by arterial embolization or most commonly by surgical approaches are recommended (Table 7). UCS and/or PVL are recommended to avoidhysterectomy when laparotomy is performed.,"(260.867919921875, 458.9800109863281, 551.6688842773438, 320.7041931152344)","(17, 18)",1471
12,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,The most mentionedUCS techniques in guidelines are B- Lynch Hayman and/or Cho su- tures while the most cited PVL techniques are bilateral uterine and/ or utero- ovarian vessel ligations and less frequently hypogastric ligature.1– 10 PVL and UCS can also be used together. Embolization is also cited as a conservative therapeutic strat- egy however it is most often indicated in places where spe- cialized equipment and professionals are available in a timely manner.1– 5 7 10 Therefore these conditions may limit its use in acute bleedings. If bleeding is severe especially in low- resource settings some guidelines recommend the use of temporizing measures such as aortic compression and more recently the nonpneumatic antishock garment (NASG) to reduce blood loss until appropriate care is avail- able or while awaiting transfer to a higher- level facility.3 7 14 15 NASG has been recommended by WHO and FIGO for postpartum women with severe hemorrhage showing signs of shock or hemodynamic instability at all levels of care especially at the primary healthcare level or if transport to a higher facility is necessary.3 14 15 Regarding hysterectomy it is usually recommended when other procedures have failed to control massive bleeding or when they were not indicated. Guidelines highlight that hysterectomy shouldbe performed “sooner rather than later ” before the patient devel- ops coagulopathy.1– 7 9 10 Recently damage control surgery (intra- abdominal or pelvic packing) has been mentioned in some PPH guidelines as an approach for critically ill patients with persistent bleeding after hysterectomy.4 7 Finally many guidelines also address statements for the manage- ment of genital tract trauma (especially uterine inversion and uterine rupture) coagulopathy disorders and retained placenta in obstetric patients. Because of the high maternal morbidity and mortality re-lated to the placenta accreta spectrum and its relation to the high rates of cesarean deliveries in many countries around the world  |  21 ESCOBAR Et Al.

BOX 4 FIGO recommends the preparedness of obstetric care teams for the management of PPH according to the updated guidelines established locally regionally or globally. • These guidelines should include medical and nonmedical treatment options according to the degree of development of each country or region. • Local regional and national medical and nonmedical op- tions for prevention and treatment of PPH need to con- sider the resources available locally. • National societies are encouraged to lobby to establish a PPH bundle approach and ensure availability of medical supplies and surgical equipment. |  27 ESCOBAR Et Al. 7  |  MEDICAL PREVENTION AND TREATMENT 7.1  |  Carbetocin versus oxytocin use in PPH: recent evidence Oxytocin has been traditionally used as the first- line uterotonic for the prevention of PPH. Since 1992 carbetocin has been extensivelytested in the management of PPH.1 2 Beyond its uterotonic effects  carbetocin may also promote blood coagulation.3 7.1.1  |  Clinical evidence for PPH prevention: oxytocin versus carbetocin (vaginal delivery) The Heat- Stable Carbetocin versus Oxytocin to Prevent Hemorrhage after Vaginal Birth (CHAMPION) study provided new evidence comparing oxytocin and carbetocin.4 It studied 29 645 women with cervical dilation <6 cm having a singleton pregnancy and planned for vaginal delivery. Patients were rand-omized to receive intramuscular injection of 100 µg heat- stable carbetocin (Paban) or 10 IU oxytocin in 10 different countries. The data showed that for PPH prevention heat- stable carbetocin was not inferior to oxytocin administration for blood loss of at least 500 ml (RR 1.01 95% CI 0.95– 1.06) or the use of additional uterotonic agents. Noninferiority was not shown for the outcomeof blood loss of at least 1000 ml (RR 1.04 95% CI 0.87– 1.25). Inthis study when the two drugs were compared the following re- sults were obtained: in women with >500 ml blood loss additional uterotonic agents were required in almost 15% of cases in both arms.,"(45.60197448730469, 440.09771728515625, 290.45062255859375, 450.7042236328125)","(24, 25)",1475
16,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,When blood loss exceeded 1000 ml the requirement foradditional uterotonics was only 1.5% in both arms.3 Therefore ac- cess to drugs is key since oxytocin has problems with drug purity in low- resource settings. The safety profile appeared to be similarfor both drugs. More recently a network meta- analysis including 140 random- ized trials with data from 88 947 women was developed to identify the most effective uterotonic drug(s) to prevent PPH and generate a ranking according to their effectiveness and adverse effect pro- file.5 The data showed that compared with oxytocin the combina- tion of ergometrine plus oxytocin had a risk ratio of 0.69 (95% CI  0.57– 0.83) and was more effective however with only moderate quality evidence and with higher risk of adverse effects such as vomiting and hypertension. For carbetocin the risk ratio was 0.72(95% CI 0.52– 1.00) and although it was significant there was very low- quality evidence. Finally for misoprostol plus oxytocin the riskratio was 0.73 (95% CI 0.60– 0.90) with moderate quality evidence and higher risk of fever.5 In a low- risk setting there may be advan- tages to using well- tested and readily available drugs. When thecarbetocin effect was compared with the use of rectal misoprostol for preventing PPH in low- risk patient populations in a random- ized controlled trial among 150 pregnant women the data showed the superiority of carbetocin for efficacy.6 This was evidenced in all indices tested beyond blood loss patients had a shorter third stage of labor and reduced need for additional uterotonic drugs. Additionally adverse effects such as diarrhea shivering and fever were more pronounced with misoprostol administration.6 In a ran- domized controlled trial of patients with severe pre- eclampsia car- betocin was shown to be a good alternative to oxytocin requiring a lower volume per dose.7 7.1.2  |  Clinical evidence for PPH prevention: oxytocin versus carbetocin (cesarean delivery) Cesarean delivery is a surgical procedure requiring high skill oper- ating time anesthesia intravenous fluids and different drugs. Theaddition of carbetocin therefore is expected to be of benefit and the need for a single drug administration reduces the need for an intensive management team which is generally required following a cesarean delivery. A Cochrane review including 11 studies showedthat despite a statistically significant reduction in the need for fur- ther uterotonics in the carbetocin group compared with oxytocin in women undergoing a cesarean delivery no statistically significant differences in terms of the risk of PPH were noted.8 In 2018 a meta- analysis to analyze the effectiveness of carbetocin compared with oxytocin for the prevention of PPH in cesarean deliveries (seven studies involving 2012 patients) demonstrated a significant reduc- tion in the rates of PPH (RR 0.79 95% CI 0.66– 0.94 P = 0.009) use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.57 95% CI 0.49– 0.65 P < 0.001)  and transfusion (RR 0.31 95% CI 0.15– 0.64 P = 0.002) when carbe- tocin was used instead of oxytocin. However despite the potentialbenefits the disparity between the cost of carbetocin and oxytocin suggests that a locoregional cost- effectiveness analysis should be performed before making the decision to adopt carbetocin for rou- tine prophylaxis.9 In 2020 sequential trial analysis of five randomized controlled trials of studies with data on women (a total of 1214) undergoing nonelective cesarean deliveries where carbetocin was compared with oxytocin was performed.10 The need for additional uteroton- ics was reduced with carbetocin compared with oxytocin (OR 0.30  95% CI 0.11– 0.86 I2 90.60%). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) con-firmed that the information size needed to show a significant re- duction in the need for additional uterotonics had been exceeded. No significant differences were shown with respect to any of the secondary outcomes but there was significant heterogeneity be- tween the studies. The authors concluded that further trials utiliz-ing consistent core outcomes are needed to determine an effect on PPH.10 On the other hand a single center study was carried out to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of carbetocin compared with oxy- tocin when used for prophylaxis against PPH. With approximately3000 cesarean deliveries per year the study showed that the use of carbetocin could prevent 108 episodes of PPH 104 episodes 28 |    ESCOBAR Et Al. of transfusion and 455 patients would require fewer uteroton- ics. Their cost- saving per PPH case was USD$ 278.70.11 Anotherstudy where 1500 cesarean deliveries (both elective and emer- gency) were analyzed over 12 months carbetocin use as opposed to oxytocin use reduced 30 (88 vs 58) PPH events (>500 ml blood loss) and saved £27 518. Carbetocin had a 91.5% better outcomeand was 69.4% cheaper.12 When compared with the need for ad- ditional uterotonics in the carbetocin group none required addi- tional medication versus 71.5% in the oxytocin group (P < 0.01). In another prospective cohort study carbetocin used for 400 patients undergoing cesarean delivery led to reduced PPH and the use of other oxytocic agents saving £68.93 per patient.13 In 2019 a systematic review of the cost- effectiveness of uterotonic agents for the prevention of PPH was published with 15 studies across all income categories that compared misoprostol versus no uterotonic (five studies) or versus oxytocin (one study) carbeto- cin versus oxytocin (eight studies) and one study comparing nu- merous uterotonics.14 The evidence on the cost- effectiveness of various uterotonic agents was not generalizable to different con- texts. In the absence of reliable evidence the choice of uterotonicwill likely be highly influenced by uterotonic price and contextual factors. In the context of cesarean delivery carbetocin was morecost favorable than oxytocin. The authors concluded the qualityof the evidence provided by these studies has a lack of sensitivity analyzes and incomplete description of the methods of outcome and costs measurements in most studies.,"(45.63871765136719, 441.1042175292969, 290.4803161621094, 385.7042236328125)","(25, 26)",1498
17,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,In addition some studiesfrom middle- income countries favoring carbetocin were funded by the manufacturer. They interpreted findings from these studiesand those of the conference abstracts with limited data cautiously  owing to the potential risk of bias and imprecision. Therefore itcan be easily inferred that the relative cost- effectiveness of car- betocin is still inconclusive. Beyond its primary efficacy which is reduced blood loss a drug's safety profile must also be considered before wide- scale utilization. The adverse effects of carbetocin and oxytocin wereexamined in a small randomized study.15 The data showed that car- betocin had a lower rate of nausea. In contrast with other clinicalindices including the need to stabilize systolic blood pressure and heart rate no other differences were noted.15 Since anesthesiolo- gists administer carbetocin for cesarean delivery the requirement for increased dose beyond the standard 100 ug in some instances was raised.16 The longer half- life of carbetocin prevents additional dosing in case of a persistent bleed and does not permit additional oxytocin administration. The increase in carbetocin dose from100 µg to 140 µg injection increases cardiovascular complications.17 Thus in cases of pre- eclampsia close attention is warranted for preserving patient safety before high dose carbetocin is adminis- tered. Also in those cases oxytocin doses must be increased tocontrol bleeding beyond the standard treatment mainly if the drug was used during labor which may also increase complications rate. A case report showed that carbetocin administration for a patient with asthma led to nearly fatal bronchospasm and cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation which was successful.18 Therefore this drug should be used with caution in patients with asthma or those with advanced pulmonary pathology. This and other studies showinconsistency in adverse events data and indicate that the utility of carbetocin should be further assessed in additional pregnancy pathologies to establish the population in which the risk– benefit profile is favorable.

An antifibrinolyticdrug is useful because hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion are common in the early stages of major postpartum bleeding and although existing medical and surgical interventions can be used to treat postpartum bleeding TXA offers an alternative way to sup- port hemostasis. 8.1  |  Administration of TXA 1. Administration of TXA is recommended as soon as the di-agnosis of PPH is made if the diagnosis is made within 3 h of delivery. When more than 3 h has elapsed since deliverythere is no clear evidence of benefit from TXA administration. TXA for PPH treatment is given 1 g IV over 10 min within 3 h of vaginal or cesarean delivery. One gram (10 ml of a100 mg/ml solution) is infused over 10– 20 min because infu- sion >1 ml/min can cause hypotension. If bleeding continuesafter 30 min or stops and restarts within 24 h after the first dose a second dose of 1 g may be given. The antifibrinolyticeffect lasts up to 7– 8 h in the serum. The concentration inbreast milk is approximately one hundredth of the serum peak concentration so it is unlikely to have antifibrinolytic effects in the infant.2 3 The WOMAN trial found that administration of TXA within 3 h of delivery to women with established PPH decreases maternal mortality secondary to bleeding and reduces the need for laparotomy to control hemorrhage.2 2. TXA as a management strategy in addition to uterotonics re-duced the risk of PPH in randomized trials. Its use is effectivein high- risk clinical settings (e.g. delivery of patients who refuseblood products patients with a significant risk for PPH such as placenta accreta or placenta previa or previous PPH). Usually1 g TXA intravenously is recommended within 10 min after vag- inal delivery in addition to oxytocin cord traction and uterine massage.4 5 A Cochrane review of antifibrinolytic agents used for the treatment for PPH identified three eligible trials two of which compared intravenous TXA with placebo or standard care (the WOMAN trial and a French trial).4 6 A meta- analysis of 20 172 women from the WOMAN trial and the French trial (152 women with PPH received high- dose TXA a loading dose of 4 g over 1 h followed by an infusion of 1 g over 6 h) showed that TXA reduces the risk of death due to bleeding (RR 0.81  95% CI 0.65– 1.00) with early treatment being more effective. WHO updated its recommendation on the early use of TXA for the treatment of PPH (within 3 h of birth) with intravenous TXA using the same dosing regimen as in the WOMAN trial: a fixed dose of 1 g in 10 ml (100 mg/ml) intravenously at a rate of 1 ml/ min. A second 1 g intravenous dose should be administered ifbleeding continues after 30 min or restarts within 24 h of the first dose. 3. TXA should be given to all women with clinically estimated bloodloss of more than 500 ml after vaginal birth or 1000 ml after ce- sarean delivery or any blood loss that is sufficient to compromise hemodynamic stability regardless of the cause of hemorrhage. TXA forms a reversible complex that displaces plasminogen from fibrin resulting in inhibition of fibrinolysis and inhibition of the proteolytic activity of plasmin. TXA is recommended for PPHmanagement. It is given concomitantly with other drugs and pro-cedures for control of bleeding. An antifibrinolytic drug is usefulbecause hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion are common in the early stages of major postpartum bleeding. Delay in treat-ment even if short reduces the benefit of TXA administration. The WOMAN trial found that TXA reduced death due to bleeding in women with PPH by 20%– 30% and was not associated with an increase in adverse effects. It also reduced the incidence oflaparotomy to control bleeding by 36% but did not reduce hys- terectomy rates. However the decision to perform hysterectomywas sometimes made at the same time as randomization so some hysterectomies were performed before or concurrently with ad- ministration of TXA.2 3 8.2  |  TXA as a prophylactic measure Although the WOMAN trial presents evidence for the use of TXA to treat established PPH there is limited evidence for its role in prevention of PPH. Reviews and meta- analyses of multi-ple trials have shown that prophylactic use of TXA may decrease both postpartum bleeding and the need for blood transfusions.7 8 However larger adequately powered multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed before the prophylactic use of TXA can be recommended for the prevention of PPH. In 2021 a mul-ticenter double- blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 4551 women undergoing cesarean delivery before or during labor at 34 or more gestational weeks who received an intrave- nously administered prophylactic uterotonic agent and either TXA (1 g) or placebo.,"(45.64533233642578, 128.63540649414062, 551.6649780273438, 567.7042236328125)","(27, 28)",1448
19,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Among women who underwent cesarean deliveryand received prophylactic uterotonic agents TXA treatment re- sulted in a significantly lower incidence of calculated estimated blood loss greater than 1000 ml or red- cell transfusion by day 2 compared with placebo but it did not result in a lower incidence of hemorrhage- related secondary clinical outcomes.9 Several sys- tematic reviews related to the treatment of PPH exist. Mousaet al.10 conducted a review that sought to include studies examin- ing the effectiveness of all types of treatments for PPH. Howevertheir review primarily included studies involving treatment with misoprostol and little evidence regarding TXA. They concludedthat more research was needed regarding the effectiveness of TXA for treatment of PPH.10 Additionally the existing systematic reviews that examined TXA for prophylaxis against PPH (where |  31 ESCOBAR Et Al. all laboring patients receive TXA) did not address the potential effects of administering TXA only to mothers with PPH.11 FIGO does not recommend the use of TXA prophylactically given the limited evidence in that regard. 8.3  |  Adverse reactions to TXA 1. Greater than 10%: headache (oral: 50%) abdominal pain (oral:20%) back pain (oral: 21%) musculoskeletal pain (oral: 11%)  nasal signs and symptoms (oral: 25% including sinus symptoms). 2. 1%– 10%: fatigue (oral: 5%) anemia (oral: 6%) arthralgia (oral: 7%)muscle cramps (oral: ≤7%) muscle spasm (oral: ≤7%). 3. Less than 1%: allergic dermatitis allergic skin reaction anaphylac-tic shock anaphylactoid reaction anaphylaxis cerebral thrombo- sis chromatopsia conjunctivitis (ligneous) deep vein thrombosis  diarrhea dizziness hypersensitivity reaction hypotension (with rapid intravenous injection) nausea pulmonary embolism renal cortical necrosis retinal artery occlusion retinal vein occlusion  seizure ureteral obstruction visual disturbance vomiting. 8.4  |  Contraindications Hypersensitivity to TXA or any component of the formulation. 8.5  |  Implementation of treatment with TXA 1. TXA should always be readily available in obstetric care fa-cilities. It is cost- effective heat stable and widely availablewith a long shelf life. An economic evaluation that used datafrom the WOMAN trial to assess the cost- effectiveness of early TXA for usual care of women with PPH in Nigeria and Pakistan concluded that it is likely to be highly cost- effective.4 2. TXA should be used in addition to all usual treatments for themanagement of PPH including medical (uterotonics) nonsurgical  and surgical interventions.2 3 3. It has a wide therapeutic index and a further intravenous in-jection could be given when this becomes possible. Alternativeroutes of administration should be a research priority as recom- mended by WHO.12 4. Owing to improvements in emergency obstetric care includinguse of TXA as a first- line therapy more women will survive PPH than ever before. Furthermore the incidence of PPH is increas-ing 1 and consequently the number of women who will experience its physical and psychological consequences will also increase. More research is needed on how to reduce the risk factors for PPH. REFERENCES 1. Ker K Edwards P Perel P Shakur H Roberts I.

Direct abdominal and pelvic compressionreduces the total vascular space in the lower body and decreases pelvic perfusion to pelvic compartment organs and smaller pelvic blood vessels promoting hemorrhage arrest.6 Additionally the pres- sure applied increases cardiac output and the central circulation al- lowing an increased distribution of blood flow to vital upper body organs (heart lung brains) and contributing to a rapid recovery from shock.1 7 Likewise the direct compression of the descending aorta re- duces bleeding from the uterine arteries and the mesenteric bed's vasculature perhaps decreasing up to 90% of blood flow at the level of the superior mesenteric artery.1 8 A further property of the NASG that makes it useful for maternal hemorrhage is the easy access to the vagina and perineum thereby facilitating genital medical and surgical interventions. Additionallyit is extremely cost- effective even for very low- resource settings  and is reusable as it can be disinfected and washed over 100 times without losing its compressive effects.3 It is also adjustable for many women of different girths and heights. 9.1.1  |  Safety According to human studies the NASG is a safe device with no ad- verse effects such as abdominal wall lesions or other types of po- tential injuries secondary to the circumferential pressure applied  independent of the patient's body mass index or the strength used to close each of the segments of the garment.2 In multiple studies  there were no adverse events associated with NASG use: no in- creased rates of dyspnea cardiac or renal dysfunctions. In fact inall studies of NASG involving extremely ill women with severe PPH  there were decreased rates of all severe maternal morbidities.4 Doppler studies of the distal aorta when the NASG is applied have shown a drop in the flow rate (volume/time) up to 33%. Additionally when the garment's abdominal and pelvic segments are placed the resistive index (inversely proportional to flow rate) of the internal iliac arteries increases.7 9.1.2  |  Effectiveness and advantages Multiple studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy and ef- fectiveness of the NASG. Observational quasi- experimental studiesat referral centers in Egypt Nigeria India Zambia and Zimbabwe showed a 48% drop in maternal mortality related to hypovolemic shock (secondary to PPH).2 Overall the groups that received NASG treatment required fewer transfers to higher complexity facilities as well as abdominal hysterectomies (for definitive therapeutic ap- proach) than women in the control groups with a relative risk of 0.44 (95% CI 0.23– 0.86).9 A randomized controlled trial implemented in Zambia and Zimbabwe demonstrated that early placement of the NASG at pri- mary healthcare centers was associated with a statistically signifi- cant decline in shock recovery time (defined as shock index <0.9)  with a median time to recovery of 170 min for the NASG group ver- sus 209 min for the control group with a hazard ratio of 1.2 (95% CI  1.02– 1.52 P = 0.03). Although the reduction in mortality and severematernal morbidities (54%) in this study was not statistically signif- icant (perhaps due to much smaller sample size than was necessary to show statistical significance) it is still significant considering the seriousness of the outcomes.10 In 2015 a systematic review of quasi- experimental studies and the trial above compared PPH standard care versus standard care plus NASG. It found that the use of the NASG combined with stan-dard PPH care reduces both maternal mortality (48%) with a relative risk of 0.52 (95% CI 0.36– 0.77) and a 68% reduction in combined adverse outcomes mortality and severe morbidities (RR 0.31 95% CI 0.17– 0.59). Furthermore safety was demonstrated by the ab-sence of differences in adverse events among groups.2 Effectiveness outside of clinical trials has been reported in one large implementation project in Tanzania that was conducted in 280 healthcare facilities in four rural regions with over 1700 women with PPH 24.5% (n = 419) of whom had severe PPH and hypovolemic shock.11 Of these women 70.8% received the NASG which indicated high utilization and high acceptability. There was also a temporal as-sociation of a 67% reduced risk of mortality among women with se- vere PPH during the project (RR 0.33 95% CI 0.16– 0.60). Use of the NASG is recommended for the clinical stabilization and safe transfer to high complexity centers in the clinical scenario of PPH. This device is currently used in over 50 countries world-wide and it has been recommended in many national and interna- tional guidelines such as GLOWM WHO FIGO and others.12– 15 This device should be present in every healthcare facility as it has proven to be effective and safe granting significant reductions in PPH- related mortality.3 15 16 Besides the acceptability demonstrated in the Tanzania study qualitative research in a few settings has re- ported high acceptability from women and providers.11 17– 19 |  33 ESCOBAR Et Al. 9.1.3  |  Indications Women with PPH presenting with clinical signs or laboratory find- ings compatible with shock or hemodynamic instability are suitable for treatment with the NASG.,"(306.8655090332031, 628.5928955078125, 288.42578125, 112.70418548583984)","(29, 31)",1493
21,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,It is important to note that the gar-ment serves as a temporizing measure. Thus once hemodynamicstability is restored patients should receive definitive medical and surgical treatment. Table 8 provides a reference for the indicationsfor NASG application.3 9.1.4  |  Instructions for use The NASG is composed of six articulated segments. The first threesegments are bilateral and independent segments for the lower body parts: ankles calves and thighs. The other three circumferen-tial segments are placed over the pelvic and abdominal areas. It mustfirst be unfolded entirely and placed under the patient's body. Toassure proper application of the garment placement of the superior edge of segment 6 (the superior segment) over the lower rib should be confirmed. The device can be adjusted to all sizes and heights. Forinstance in shorter patients segment 1 can be folded into segment 2 to keep the first applied segment at the ankle and it can be per- formed whenever someone who is competent to insert it is available. For garment applications each segment must be stretched and closed as tightly as possible starting at the ankles with segment 1 and continuing with the remaining segments successively.5 It is im- portant to try to keep both knees uncovered by the leg segments to preserve joint mobility. The leg segments of the NASG can be placedby one or two people depending on the availability of healthcare personnel. Appliers can use the pubic symphysis as an anatomicalreference point for placing segment 4. Appliers can use the umbili-cus as guidance for placing segments 5 and 6. Although all segmentsshould be closed firmly and tightly the abdominal section must not be closed too tightly in order to maintain adequate respiration. Forthat reason it is advised that only one person should close segments 5 and 6. If there is more than one person available two people cancoordinate their actions with one person presenting the opposite segment to the person who will close both segments together. If thepatient shows signs of respiratory distress abdominal segments (5 and 6) can be loosened but not completely opened. If the patient requires surgical intervention the leg sections should remain closed while the pelvic and abdominal segments can be tem- porarily opened just before the skin incision is made and then closed once the procedure is concluded. In addition a drop in blood pres-sure should be expected when the abdominal and pelvic segments are opened and hence appropriate measures should be taken. 9.1.5  |  Monitoring and removal Patients using the NASG should be closely followed with continuous monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure and optimal fluid resus- citation.5 This device can be used safely for up to 48 h as a tempo- rizing measure until hemodynamic stability or adequate hemorrhage control is achieved. Nevertheless there are reports of the NASGused for longer than 72 h. To safely remove the NASG healthcareprofessionals must verify the following criteria: blood loss <50 ml/h  heart rate <100 bpm and systolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg (rule of 100’s) for at least 2 h.5 Once the following criteria are corrobo- rated it is safe to start removing the garment. The intravenous lineshould remain in situ during the removal. Removal should follow thesame steps as application starting with segment 1 at the ankles and moving slowly up to segment 6. Every time a segment is opened a15- min period is allowed to re- evaluate vital signs and check for ac- tive bleeding. If vital signs remain stable and there are no signs of ac-tive bleeding it is safe to open the next segment. However if systolicblood pressure drops ≥20 mm Hg or heart rate increases ≥20 bpm (rule of 20’s) or active bleeding is identified all of the segments must be rapidly closed again. Once removed the NASG should be placed ina biohazard container and sent to be laundered dried and refolded. Videos and presentation slides of correct application use removal  and cleaning can be obtained for free at: www.safem other hood. ucsf.edu. These instructions must be followed strictly as incorrectremoval of the garment could result in hemodynamic instability and recurrence of shock especially if the abdominal segment is the first segment to be opened.5 In the absence of hemodynamic instability TA B LE 8 Indications for NASG applicationa FIGO recommendations on use of the nonpneumatic anti- shock garment for hypovolemic shock secondary to obstetric hemorrhage Population Any pregnant or postpartum woman with severe hemorrhage showing signs of shock/hemodynamic instability  at the primary healthcare level or if transport to higher facility is necessary: EBL 500 ml SBP <100 mm Hg pulse >100 bpm at high- level facilities: EBL >1000 ml SBP <90 mm Hg pulse >110 bpm (or per facility protocols) Recommendation Rapidly apply NASG starting at the ankles.

If bleeding does not stop after its insertion then it isbetter to review the etiology of PPH. Placement of a UBT deviceshould be considered early when emergency measures for man- agement of PPH are initiated. It should be performed by compe-tent healthcare providers who are trained in its insertion to avoid complications that can arise from misplacement. Perineal vaginaland cervical tears and ruptured uterus must be excluded and the placenta carefully assessed for completeness to rule out retained fragments of the placenta. First- line emergency interventions foratonic PPH include uterine massage initiation of large intravenous BOX 7 FIGO recommends that all healthcare facilities have the NASG as an effective nonsurgical device that can be used as a temporary measure to recover hemodynamic stability for the management and transfer of a patient to a high level of care. |  35 ESCOBAR Et Al. access emptying the uterus and bladder and administration of oxytocin and TXA (first response bundle).,"(45.60940170288086, 463.1278991699219, 290.4587097167969, 73.70418548583984)","(32, 33)",1408
23,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,If the uterus fails tocontract ergometrine or misoprostol should be administered bi- manual uterine or aortic compression should be initiated a UBT placed and the NASG applied (response to refractory PPH bun- dle).2 These two sets of approaches have recently been defined as the “PPH bundle”.3 Observational studies have reported UBT success rates between 83% and 95% overall with nearly 100% survival among women with uncontrolled hemorrhage when a UBT device was placed before the onset of advanced shock.4– 6 The integration of UBT into PPH clinical pathways in high- income countries has been shown to avert hyster- ectomy and significantly reduce the need for PPH- related invasive procedures such as artery ligation uterine compression sutures and arterial embolization.7– 10 A 2020 systematic review and meta- analysis showed an overall pooled success rate of 85.9% (95% CI 83.9– 87.9%) for the treatment of PPH with higher pooled success rates corresponding to PPH due to uterine atony and placenta previa and lower pooled success rates for PPH due to placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) and retained prod- ucts of conception.11 A safety trial in Kenya and Sierra Leone on a uniquely designed condom uterine tamponade device (ESM- UBT) demonstrated no increased risk of infections or perineal injuries and success rates of condom UBT devices appear to be comparable to those of Bakri balloons.12 Available UBT devices and specific consid- erations are described below. 9.2.1  |  Available UBT devices Uterine balloon devices can be divided into two groups: 1. Fixed volume devices: condom uterine balloons (ESM- UBT kitCG balloon) Bakri balloon Rusch balloon and Ebb system.12– 16 2. Free flow devices: the glove balloon Ellavi UBT and Zukovskiballoon.17– 19 The glove and Ellavi balloons allow intrauterine pres- sure control according to systolic blood pressure. The Zukovskiballoon uses 50 cm (3.8 cmHg) pressure for inflating the balloon. 9.2.2  |  Tamponade effect The mechanism of action of UBT devices is likely multifactorial. Twoproposed mechanisms include device stimulation of receptors which in turn stimulates uterine contraction as well as the direct application of hydrostatic pressure against the bleeding sinuses. It has been proposedthat if uterine wall pressure exerted by a UBT equals the systolic arte- rial pressure of the bleeding sinuses a tamponade effect is created.14 However Georgiou20 measured intraluminal pressures in Bakri bal- loons in two cases where UBTs had been placed and discovered that tamponade occurred at UBT device pressures lower than systolic blood pressures. Further research is needed to better understand the precisebiomechanical relationship between a UBT device and a bleeding uterus. 9.2.3  |  Free flow tamponade device Blood is supplied to the uterus via maternal arterial blood that passes through the myometrium through low resistance sinuses.21 Following delivery of the placenta the muscle fibers of the myome- trium contract and retract closing off the sinuses and limiting blood loss. While the immediate aim in PPH due to atonic uterus is to arrestblood loss the ultimate goal is to employ best practice interventions to facilitate contraction of the myometrium. The surgical glove bal-loon the Ellavi UBT and the Zukovsky balloon are free flow systems that allow water to be expelled from the balloon to theoretically better allow for the natural physiological process of contraction and retraction of the myometrium once the uterus has recovered.17– 19 However almost all commercially available UBT devices are low- pressure high- volume systems that allow for easy UBT expulsion when the uterus regains its tone and begins to contract. 9.2.4  |  Drainage port The need for a drainage port with a UBT device is questionable.13 14 16 Drainage ports are only a few millimeters in diameter and there- fore are easily obstructed by clotted blood. Furthermore since thesource of bleeding in atonic uterus is from the site of placental im- plantation which encompasses only about 20% of the uterine cavity  a drainage port is less likely to be in proximity to the bleeding site. 9.2.5  |  Correct placement Multiple techniques have been described on the best approach to place a UBT device. The approach should in part be determined bythe device being used (e.g. stiffness of the introducing end and num-ber of balloons). To ensure that the balloon could engage within thearea that is actively bleeding all UBTs should be inserted through the cervix and positioned to sit in the upper uterine segment. Oneapproach includes placing the hand into the uterus and ensuring that the fingertips reach the thick anterior and posterior layers of the upper segment. The UBT is then fed into the upper segment of theuterus with the free hand. When withdrawing the uterine hand thetubing is held with the free hand. While the balloon is filled two fin-gers are held in the vagina below the cervix to prevent inadvertent balloon expulsion. 9.2.6  |  Assessment of effect Multiple studies have shown that women with uncontrolled PPH from an atonic uterus will almost universally survive if a UBT device is placed in a timely fashion. If UBTs are placed before patients pro-gress to advanced shock success rates approach 100%.6 However  studies such as by Dumont et al.22 and Natarajan et al.23 have shown that improvised UBTs delays in recognition of PPH and lack of 36 |    ESCOBAR Et Al. action on actual UBT placement may be barriers to improved out- comes. While different UBT systems may fill to their desired statesat different rates it is even more important to recognize that impro- vised and untested UBTs are less often used. Moreover wheneverthey are their use is often delayed they are more difficult to place  fall out more easily and are associated with overall lower success rates.12– 14 17 19 Therefore immediate recognition of PPH and emer- gency action with a quality UBT device is imperative to save lives. 9.2.7  |  Transfer Many studies report high rates of hemorrhage control after UBT insertion thus rendering transfers unnecessary. Most often incor-rect diagnosis and misplacement are the cause of UBT failure. Ifbleeding recurs or the patient continues to be unstable after UBT insertion then consideration of transfer to higher levels of care should be made.,"(45.63779830932617, 64.10418701171875, 288.41339111328125, 281.7041931152344)","(33, 34)",1467
24,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Transfer can occur with both fixed- volume bal-loons and closed- off free- flow balloons but all UBTs must be care- fully secured to prevent accidental displacement. A transfer planshould be in place in all obstetric settings regardless of whether it will be needed or not. This is an absolute necessity in PPH bundles. 9.2.8  |  UBT after cesarean delivery Use of UBTs for hemorrhage control after cesarean delivery is a commonly performed technique worldwide but there is scant sup- porting literature. There are a few reports on successful outcomeswith use of UBT in placenta previa. It appears that UBT has highersuccess rates in women with PPH after vaginal delivery than after cesarean delivery.11 18 24– 26 9.2.9  |  Combining UBT with compression sutures Placing a UBT after application of uterine compression sutures requires control of the amount of pressure exerted in the uterus to prevent uterine necrosis. Although uterine necrosis is possiblefollowing the insertion of compression sutures alone the risk un- derstandably would increase with pressure exerted from inside the uterus when UBT is used additionally. Cases with uterine necro-sis following insertion of compression sutures have been reported with and without UBT.27 28 The surgical glove balloon and the Ellavi UBT are UBT devices that allow the intrauterine pressure to be controlled by adjusting the height of the intravenous fluid bag or supply bag above the patient.17 18 With systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg and the supply bag or intravenous infusion fluid 1.3 m above the patient the pressure exerted by the balloon will be 100 mm Hg. The specific gravity of mercury is 13 times more thanwater. The device used for the balloon must be large enough to beinflated with fluid without requiring any expansion pressure. This isachieved by using a surgical glove and the Ellavi UBT.17 18 9.2.10  |  Other uses of UBT While the use of UBT for uncontrolled PPH is fairly well estab- lished published case reports and senior leaders in obstetrics and gynecology have described successful use of UBTs in other cir- cumstances such as in molar pregnancy- associated hemorrhage  placenta accreta retained placenta and in cases of intentional vaginal and cervical placement to temporize uncontrolled bleed- ing from lacerations.29 WHO recently published recommendations regarding use of UBT in the context of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth in women who do not respond to standard first- line treatment.30 According to WHO among the prerequisites for use of UBT evi- dence supports the need for access to surgical intervention and blood products as well as the availability of health personnel skilled in its use. They recognize that conditions may not be operationalizedacross all clinical settings and that observational studies suggest a substantial reduction in the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality following uterine balloon tamponade and that further research is needed in low- resource settings.

However unlike the medical and surgi-cal treatments for PPH no randomized controlled trials regarding its effectiveness have been conducted. The decision to perform uterineartery embolization in patients with persistent uterine bleeding should be made in consultation with an interventional radiologist. Althoughembolization may be considered as the technique of choice for manag- ing PPH by some authors certain practical issues must be considered.1 Uterine artery embolization has been shown to be effective in the treatment of various causes of PPH including placenta accreta: Both UAE and uterine artery ligation have reported success rates of greater than 90% with low complication rates. If both techniques areavailable embolization is the preferred first choice as it obviates lap- arotomy. Ligation can be attempted subsequently if embolization isunsuccessful.,"(45.645301818847656, 170.63540649414062, 551.657958984375, 463.7041015625)","(35, 35)",1480
26,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,In contrast after an unsuccessful uterine artery ligationembolization may be extremely difficult or even impossible leaving hysterectomy as the only remaining option. Some cases may requirehysterectomy because of failure of embolization. UAE has shown to beeffective in controlling secondary bleeding and the placenta was found to gradually decrease in size in all patients. UAE plays an important rolein managing these patients because it is effective at reducing uteropla- cental blood flow to further induce thrombosis of the intervillous space and to achieve necrosis of the retained placental tissue.2– 7 Selective UAE is effective in the control of PPH thus avoiding hysterectomy. Availability of resources to perform the procedure: A radiologist trained in embolization techniques is a prerequisite as is the appro- priate equipment for vascular intervention. Digital road- mappingmay be required and the possible complexity means that this proce- dure can only be performed in a fully equipped X- ray department.8 The interventional radiologist inserts sheaths into both femoral ar- teries to deploy a deflated occlusion balloon into each of the internal iliac arteries.9 The sheaths are removed and the deflated balloons remain in place until after delivery. After the patient has undergonea cesarean delivery the interventional radiologist will inflate the balloons if needed based on the amount of bleeding. If inflating the38 |    ESCOBAR Et Al. balloons is postponed the balloons may remain in place for up to a few days until the patient's providers are certain she will not begin to bleed again the balloons can then be removed.9 UAE has become recognized as a relatively safe technique when preserving the patient's fertility is a priority10– 12: Catheterization of the uterine arteries with temporary occlusion by endovascular bal- loon is considered a valid option in the management of patients at high risk of bleeding in particular those with a pre- existing diagnosis of placenta accreta in patients requesting to preserve their uterus. Ojala et al.13 and Badawy14 described a series of cases in patients who underwent embolization of the uterine arteries. Catheterizationaverted hysterectomy in close to 80% of cases. 9.3.1  |  Complications Some studies have documented resumption of menses and even pregnancies after the procedure.15 Complications of pelvic embo- lization for PPH occur at a rate of 8.7%. The most common com-plication is low- grade fever. Less common complications are pelvicinfection groin hematoma iliac artery perforation transient buttock ischemia transient foot ischemia and bladder gangrene. Lee et al.16listed dissection of the uterine arteries hematoma at the puncture site paresthesia and lower limb edema as complications. Currently most PPH cases requiring hysterectomy are related to placenta previa.17 . These patients are commonly diagnosed beforedelivery and are usually delivered by elective cesarean delivery. Thisplanning may allow increased use of invasive radiological services in the management of such cases by inserting the intra- arterial bal- loons before going to surgery. 9.3.2  |  Implementation of treatment 1. A radiologist trained in embolization techniques is a prerequisiteas is the appropriate equipment for vascular intervention. Digitalroad- mapping may be required and the possible complexity means that this procedure can only be performed in a fully equipped X- ray department.8 2. The obstetrics staff and interventional radiologist select the ap-propriate operative procedure (UAE or cesarean hysterectomy) based on the patient's clinical condition and a refractory response to conservative medical management.8 3.

BOX 9 FIGO recommends uterine artery embolization for refractory bleeding uncontrolled by medical and nonsurgical treatment modalities with the availability of trained personnel and necessary equipment for using this technology. |  39 ESCOBAR Et Al. 10  |  SURGICAL TREATMENT 10.1  |  Uterine compression sutures for PPH When a decision is made for surgical intervention adequate opera- tive theatre should be set up with adequate anesthesia surgical and nursing staff and blood should be available for transfusion. Uponlaparotomy bleeding at the surgical site should be minimized by ad- equate packing to minimize time lost for suturing while active bleed- ing is ongoing. In all cases the uterus should be fully exteriorized ifpossible. Blood loss should be minimized while fully extending theuterus causing vasoconstriction and a tourniquet placed around the low segment until surgical compression sutures are successfully ap- plied.1 This enables the surgical team to use the following described methods by applying the uterine compression sutures with a high degree of safety. In addition injections of vasopressin at a doseof 4 U in 20 ml of saline in the placental bed after removal of the placenta may lead to reduced blood loss as well.2 Placement of en- douterine square hemostatic sutures may also be used to control bleeding from the placental bed.3 Hemostatic suturing technique as a second- line strategy for con- trol of uterine bleeding due to uterine atony is an effortless fast and conservative surgical procedure. It can be performed satisfactorilyafter a cesarean delivery or after a vaginal delivery.4 Complications related to its application have been identified but there are no re- ports of deaths related to compression sutures. Complications caninclude uterine synechia or ischemia uterine necrosis 5 intrauterine infection 6 and strangulation of the intestinal loop and abdominal omentum when nonabsorbable stitches are used 7 but nonabsorb- able sutures can be used if other types of sutures are not available. While most births are uncomplicated obstetricians are often faced with PPH at the time of vaginal or cesarean delivery.8 9 If ini- tial management with fundal massage manual uterine compression  or uterotonics (oxytocin misoprostol methergine or carboprost tromethamine) does not adequately reduce bleeding placement of compression sutures can be done to slow bleeding and stabilize the patient avoid hysterectomy and ultimately reduce maternal mor- bidity or death. The three most used compression suture techniquesfor PPH are B- Lynch 10 Hayman 11 and Pereira.12 Other compression sutures are cited in the literature such as Cho Ouahba Hackethal  and Massuba.8 If a Bakri balloon is available the obstetrician can combine any of these three compression sutures with the placement of the balloon to tamponade bleeding. In some instances expedientplacement of an O’Leary stitch for temporary devascularization of the uterine arteries can decrease bleeding and allow additional time for placement of the compression sutures. As with the conduct ofcesarean delivery specific practical issues have to be considered. First the obstetrician should be well versed in sterile pelvic vascular operative techniques as placement of sutures will occur at the time of cesarean delivery or with laparotomy following vaginal delivery and PPH. Second since time is critical to reducing maternal bloodloss an operative team with the technical skills for additional an- esthesia administration of blood products and surgical assistance is crucial to the success of surgical management. Three commonlyused compression sutures are described below and existing data are summarized on the effectiveness of each compression technique. 10.1.1  |  Commonly used compression sutures for managing PPH The B- Lynch suture was first introduced in 1997 by Christopher Lynch to address hemorrhage with open hysterotomy at the time of cesarean delivery.10 A suture is placed on the right side of the hysterotomy entering at the base of the incision and exiting at the top.13 The suture is then carried across the top of the right fundus and a posterior stitch is placed with the entrance of the suture at the same level of the anterior suture and exiting on the left posterior side of the uterus at the level of the uterine incision. Suture is thenlooped over the left fundus and another stitch is placed at the top of the left side of the uterine incision and exiting at the base of the incision. The suture is then tugged tightly compressing the body ofthe uterus with placement of a surgeon's knot. Following placementof the B- Lynch suture the transverse hysterotomy is closed in the usual fashion. In the original description of B- Lynch a chromic su-ture was used. Subsequent case studies have reported successfuluse of a monocryl suture. Additional options for compression sutures include the Hayman and Pereira.,"(306.8511657714844, 421.5976867675781, 551.6923217773438, 385.7041931152344)","(36, 37)",1465
28,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,In 2002 the Hayman suture was designed tobe a technically easier alternative to the B- Lynch suture that could be placed expediently and not require hysterotomy. The steps forplacing a Hayman suture include two to four longitudinal (on the left and right side of the uterus) sutures that pass directly from the anterior uterine wall and through the posterior uterine wall and are tied using a surgeon's knot at the fundus. A transversecervicoisthmic suture traversing the anterior and posterior uterine walls can be placed to address bleeding from the lower uterine segment. The Pereira compression technique includes five sutures com- bining two longitudinal sutures with three transverse sutures. Theadvantage of the Pereira sutures is that placement occurs in the submucosal region and avoids the endometrial cavity. However at-tention is needed for correct placement of the transverse sutures to prevent damage to the uterine vessels and ureters. Based on the available literature the success rate of compres- sion sutures in achieving hemostasis is 76%– 100%.14 To date no randomized controlled trials or controlled studies have compared the efficacy of the different compression sutures. In the three orig-inal studies for B- Lynch Hayman and Pereira success rates were reported as 100% (5/5 for B- Lynch 3/3 for Hayman and 7/7 for Pereira). In a systematic review 14 the overall success rate of com-pression sutures was reported as 91.7%. Given the broad use ofcompression sutures and the impact on maternal morbidity and mortality it is unlikely that a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of different compression techniques will be conducted. However an observational study comparing the effectiveness of 40 |    ESCOBAR Et Al. different compression sutures on estimated blood loss and measures of maternal morbidity is an obvious next step to move the literature forward.

Internal iliac artery liga-tion may avoid the need for hysterectomy in the context of uterine atony.2 In addition in cases of traumatic PPH such as uterine rupture and extensive genital injuries internal artery ligation clears the op- erative field and facilitates hysterectomy.2 During the procedure the common iliac artery is identified. After dissection the ureter is visualized crossing the common iliac artery at its bifurcation. The common iliac artery branches into aninternal iliac (hypogastric) artery coursing medially and inferiorly  and the external iliac artery coursing laterally and superiorly. Thearteries are not infrequently adherent to the underlying veins and require appropriate dissection.5 With right- angled forceps a su- ture is introduced between the artery and the vein and a knot is made.4 5 Noteworthy is that even after bilateral internal iliac artery li- gation the vascular supply to the pelvis is not completely compro- mised due to the extensive collateral circulation that exists.4 5 The revascularization is provided by the deep femoral artery the anas- tomosis between the medial femoral circumflex and obturator ar- tery and that between the lateral femoral circumflex and superior gluteal artery and the ovarian artery.4 5 Obstetricians ought to be more familiar with this procedure as it is an effective and rapid way to control PPH.

Sapiens Publishing 2012:441– 447. 10.4  |  Hysterectomy Peripartum hysterectomy is performed in the treatment of PPH when all other conventional methods fail to control the bleeding.1 The prevalence is higher in low- income regions than in high- income regions (2.8 and 0.7 per 1000 deliveries respectively).2 The in- cidence of this procedure has been on the rise increasing by 15% in the USA between 1994 and 2007.3 Similarly in Turkey the rate has increased from 0.03% in 2000– 2006 to 0.07% in 2007– 2013. In most of the studies this was attributed to the increased rates of cesarean delivery.1– 5 The most common indications for peripartum hysterectomy are placental pathology such as abnormal placentation placenta previa  and placental abruption (38%) uterine atony (27%) and uterine rup- ture (26%).2 Peripartum hysterectomy is associated with high rates of maternal morbidity and complications due to the need for blood transfusions coagulation disorders injury to the urinary tract the need for re- exploration in case of persistent bleeding and postop- erative fever.1 The maternal mortality rate varies according to countries rang- ing from 0% in Turkey 6 the UK 7 and New Zealand 8 to 3.2% in Australia 9 and as high as 11.8% in Nigeria.10 REFERENCES 1.

31,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,11  |  ASSESSMENT AND RESUSCITATION 11.1  |  Damage control resuscitation in PPH Hemorrhagic shock is the most frequent type of shock in ob- stetric patients.1 Blood loss exceeding 40% of total blood vol- ume leads to global hypoxia and metabolic acidosis.2 These metabolic complications accompanied by organ hypoperfusion  trigger an irreversible state of coagulopathy bolstering hemor- rhage and inducing multiple organ dysfunction and death.3 The concept of damage control resuscitation (DCR) was first reported by trauma surgeons and its applicability has spread in traumatic and nontraumatic scenarios in general surgery orthopedics and obstetrics.4 DCR consists of a series of strategies to minimize hemorrhage prevent the deadly triad (coagulopathy acidosis and hypothermia) and maximize tissue oxygenation. This is achievedby a staged surgical approach that minimizes operative time  counteracting life- threatening conditions and deferring the de- finitive surgical procedures until normal physiology is restored at the intensive care unit (ICU).5– 7 Efforts in DCR are focused on permissive resuscitation by blood product transfusion use of massive blood transfusion protocols limited use of crystalloids bleeding control (including damage control surgery [DCS] and damage control interventional radiology [DCIR]) and physiological and biochemical stabilization in the ICU.4– 6 DCR is usually reserved for severely injured patients who may not survive the surgical efforts to achieve primary re- pair in the operating room.4 It is evident that this approach can be considered only in higher- level care facilities where there is avail- ability of experienced personnel with 24- h laboratory and blood bank services. The most important aspects of DCS are described below. Hypotensive and hemostatic reanimation are discussed in sections 11.2.1 and 11.2.6 respectively. 11.1.1  |  Decision for damage control surgery Physiological and metabolic markers have been proposed to identify patients that could benefit from DCS.4 Three parameters have been described in the literature as significant clinical indica- tors for early implementation of DCR and DCS8: acidosis (base deficit >8) blood loss >1500 ml and hypothermia (temperature <35°C). Other important parameters to consider are systolicblood pressure <70 mm Hg maternal blood pH <7.1 and persis- tent bleeding despite several transfusions (defined as 6 units of packed red blood cells by some authors7 and >10 units by oth- ers4) (Table 9). Continuous vital sign monitoring and serial monitoring with blood gas analysis and body temperature are recommended. Operativetime and number of blood units transfused are also crucial for DCR decision- making.4 11.1.2  |  Bleeding control After identifying eligible DCS patients when medical and surgical conservative measures to control bleeding fail a sequential four- phase approach should be performed.4 Initial laparotomy The primary objective is hemorrhage control which is achieved by an abdominal hysterectomy. The type of hysterectomy tobe performed depends on the preference and expertise of the operator and the clinical condition of the patient other factors such as age cause of hemorrhage hemodynamic stability and pelvic anatomy must be considered.9 According to several stud- ies there are no statistically significant differences between total and subtotal hysterectomy in terms of complications blood transfusions and ICU admission.9– 11 Subtotal hysterectomy has been associated with quicker hemorrhage control and shorter operative times hence is the preferred approach over total hysterectomy.9 11 The bleeding site must be identified to pick the most suitable approach. When the bleeding is in the lower uterine segmentcervix or vaginal fornices a subtotal hysterectomy may not be the most effective approach for hemorrhage control since the ar- terial circulation of the cervix has a high blood flow rate and could cause bleeding persistence. In these cases total hysterectomy ispreferred.9 10 Operative time is a crucial determinant in patient survival. Prolonged operative time has been linked to adverse outcomes as it can institute an irreversible physiologic insult thus the need to keep operative time under 90 min.4 TA B LE 9 Alternative indications for damage control surgery secondary to postpartum hemorrhagea Indication Systolic blood pressure <70 mm Hg Body temperature <34ºC Maternal blood pH <7.1 Venous bleeding not suitable for surgical control Persistent bleeding despite several transfusions of blood products (>10 units of PRBC) Massive transfusion: 6 units of Red Blood Cells (during the first 4 h) Increasing and continuous need for fluids due to active nonarterial bleeding Hemodynamic instability requiring persistent vasopressor support or that results in the development of ventricular arrhythmias Coagulopathy resulting from a combination of hypothermia (temperature <35°C) acidosis (pH <7.3) and loss of coagulation factors Duration of surgery >90 min aSource: Carvajal et al.

The latter canbe achieved using a negative pressure system like vacuum pack or partial closure with a Viaflex bag (Bogota Bag) without the need for negative pressure.2 12 Currently there is neither consensus nor sufficient evidence regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing DCS with abdominal packing.4 Several surgi- cal guidelines recommend the administration of a single preopera- tive dose of broad- spectrum antibiotics which theoretically should provide sufficient coverage for aerobic and anaerobic microorgan- isms.4 13 14 Other experts suggest administration of prophylactic broad- spectrum antibiotics every 6– 8 h until the abdominal packing is removed. Nevertheless further studies are necessary to provideevidence- based recommendations in the obstetric population.7 Resuscitation – ICU At this stage the patient must be transferred to the ICU to address the physiologic derangements of the hemorrhagic patient: coagula- tion disorders and metabolic abnormalities.6 Interdisciplinary care involving the obstetrician and critical care specialist is key for these patients as complications could arise at any time.4 It is crucial to ac- curately quantify the accumulation of blood in the abdominal cavity. The optimal device to do so after partial abdominal closure is the vacuum pack which allows a more precise quantification of bleeding during the postoperative period. In patients without coagulopathythe drainage of >400 ml/h of blood through the vacuum pack repre- sents an early indication for laparotomy.4 Definitive surgery After restoring normal physiology it is considered safe to review the abdominal cavity.,"(45.63779830932617, 15.533536911010742, 290.4631652832031, 489.7042236328125)","(41, 42)",1501
32,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Ideally this should be performed 48– 72 h after theinitial surgical procedure.4 Patients may require one or more surgical interventions depending on the operative findings. In cases wherefurther interventions are warranted it is recommended to continue with techniques of temporary closure of the abdominal cavity.15 Definitive closure of abdominal wall and cavity The final stage is the definitive closure of the abdominal wall which is performed after all surgeries have been successfully completed and all additional damage has been repaired.4 11.1.3  |  Complications The majority of DCS complications depend on the time of closure of the abdominal fascia. It is important to consider that the numberof reinterventions is directly related to a higher percentage of infec- tious complications wound dehiscence and abdominal wall closure problems.16 The main complications include infection of the surgical wound in 28% of cases presence of intra- abdominal collections in 20% and evisceration in 10% of patients.2 Implementation of pro- phylactic antibiotic therapy could counteract these complications as it targets the polybacterial flora present in the female genital tract. An interdisciplinary approach could be required in case of complica- tions derived from injuries secondary to the surgical procedure such as urinomas perforations or fistulas among others.17 11.1.4  |  Final objectives in resuscitation DCR should be maintained as long as there are signs of bleeding and coagulopathy. A continuous assessment of the hemodynamic andphysiological status of the patient is required. Monitoring severalresuscitation parameters is essential until tissue hypoxia reverts. These parameters include pH base deficit lactate hematocrit and coagulation— ideally evaluated with conventional laboratory tests and point- of- care testing (POCT) of viscoelastic coagulation such as thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). In patients with a clinical trend toward improvement thedecision to perform definitive surgery is appropriate.4 REFERENCES 1. Pacheco LD Saade GR Gei AF Hankins GD.

33,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,There are two strategies for fluid resuscitation in patients with hemorrhage: the aggressive approach and the hypotensive resusci- tation approach. Aggressive resuscitation refers to the traditionallyused strategy in which the key principle is restoring the effective circulating blood volume and rapid normalizing of blood pressure with administration of large amounts of crystalloids.2 4 Hypotensive resuscitation also called permissive hypotension consists of restric- tive crystalloid resuscitation during the early stages of a hemorrhagic shock to maintain lower than normal systolic or mean blood pressure  sustaining organ perfusion until control of the bleeding occurs.2 5 In contrast hemostatic reanimation is based on early and ag- gressive blood product replacement transfusing red blood cells (PRBC) fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets (PLT) in the same proportion as found in circulating blood to correct coagulopathy.6– 8 Hypotensive resuscitation and hemostatic reanimation are the fun- damentals for DCR.9 10 11.2.1  |  Hypotensive resuscitation The concept of hypotensive resuscitation is because administering small crystalloid volumes reduces the risk of dilutional coagulopathy and maintaining a lower blood pressure is less likely to disintegrate the pre- formed blood clots. Aggressive resuscitation may worsen coagu-lopathy and hemorrhage by increasing intravascular hydrostatic pres- sures diluting coagulation factors and inducing more hypothermia  which results in deterioration of the triad of death.4 10 11 Furthermore  an excessive rise in blood pressure could also result in higher red blood cell loss leading to more hypoxia and acidosis in tissues.4 11 11.2.2  |  Intravenous fluids Among the initial strategies for reanimation the administration of crystalloids in small boluses of 500 ml is recommended.10 Scientific evidence recommends the use of balanced crystalloid solutions such as Ringer's lactate owing to the risk of hyperchloremic acidosis and the worsening of kidney function with chlorine- rich fluids (saline so- lution).7 This is particularly important for LMICs where saline- based solutions are in abundance. After the administration of each bolusphysicians must assess the clinical status of patients looking for an im- provement in signs and symptoms of shock resulting from blood loss.10 11.2.3  |  Targeted blood pressure The difference between aggressive and hypotensive resuscitation lies within targeted blood pressure management.4 Mean arterial pressure (MAP) represents the perfusion of the majority of organs  therefore providing the target for clinicians to guide fluid adminis- tration.11 Hemorrhagic shock animal models have demonstrated a positive benefit in survival with MAP between 55– 60 mm Hg dur- ing active bleeding.10 The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma recommends permissive hypotension with a systolic blood pressure target of 80– 90 mm Hg (MAP 50– 60 mm Hg) until major bleeding has been con- trolled (Recommendation Grade 1C).12 11.2.4  |  Aggressive approach and adverse outcomes During hemorrhagic shock the endothelial glycocalyx becomes thin- ner and administration of large amounts of crystalloids exacerbates this state leading to fluid extravasation that may cause cerebral  cardiac and pulmonary edema.7 10 11 Third spacing may also lead to cardiac dysfunction worsen hemodynamics and decrease kidney perfusion. Decreased kidney perfusion occurs because of an in-crease in intra- abdominal pressure which can additionally result in abdominal compartment syndrome.7 11 11.2.5  |  Evidence Several studies in trauma patients have demonstrated that hy- potensive resuscitation is correlated with benefits to survival  46 |    ESCOBAR Et Al. with significantly lower PRBC and amounts of fluid required in addition there is diminution in the occurrence of multiple organ dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome.2 Although recent evidence is mostly from trauma studies a cohort study of women with PPH showed that the group that received lower amounts of fluids had fewer signs of shock with less blood prod- uct requirements.13 In addition the study showed that increased fluid administration leads to decreased concentrations of fibrin- ogen hemoglobin hematocrit platelet count associated with prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time.13 The study also demonstrated that administration of >4 L of flu- ids is associated with subsequent bleeding and adverse maternal outcomes.14 11.2.6  |  Hemostatic resuscitation Resuscitation in hemorrhage was classically focused only on the administration of fluids and PRBC. The use of FFP PLT and cryo-precipitate was delayed until coagulopathy was demonstrated in paraclinics.7 Hemostatic resuscitation limits the use of crystal- loids and involves early administration of blood products (not only PRBC) making massive transfusion protocols the cornerstone of resuscitation.7 10 11.2.7  |  Transfusion ratios In hemostatic resuscitation PRBC FFP and PLT are applied in a 1:1:1 ratio due to the resemblance with whole blood and because a “high ratio” is related to fewer complications and better patient survival outcomes.6 7 10 15 If PRBC is not available then whole blood can be used instead in case of massive hemorrhage. The strongest evidence for massive transfusions comes from the Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMTT) and Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) trials. The PROMTT study evidenced an improve-ment in mortality in the first 6 h for patients with high ratios of trans- fusion (<1:2 vs ≥1:1).16 Moreover a secondary analysis from PROMTT revealed that early administration of plasma (first 3 h and within the first 3– 6 transfused units) was related to a decrease in mortality at 24 h and 30 days.17 However the PROPPR study demonstrated that patients transfused with a 1:1:1 ratio achieved hemostasis and suf- fered fewer deaths due to exsanguination at 24 h.18 11.2.8  |  Fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate In hemorrhages fibrinogen is the first clotting factor to diminish its concentrations to critical levels with values of <200 mg/dl consid- ered an indication for component replacement.7 10 Achieving specific fibrinogen levels is an important target during massive transfusion (at least 150– 200 mg/dl in PPH).7 Sources for fibrinogen replacement are FFP cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrates (which are not widely available).,"(45.63969421386719, 441.1040954589844, 549.639892578125, 73.70418548583984)","(43, 44)",1482
34,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Because fi-brinogen concentration in FFP is variable and relatively low and its administration may dilute the existent fibrinogen most fibrinogen replacement is done with cryoprecipitate.12 A unit of cryoprecipitate contains 2 g fibrinogen for each 100 ml thus a unit of cryoprecipi- tate will increase serum fibrinogen by 10 mg/dl.7 The usual dose of cryoprecipitate is 10 units which is estimated to raise serum fibrino- gen by 100 mg/dl.7 Subsequent doses must be adjusted conforming to serum fibrinogen levels. 11.2.9  |  Massive transfusion protocols As the underlying physiological imbalance and clinical course in trauma seem similar to severe PPH massive transfusion pro- tocols with high ratios utilized for trauma may be useful for PPH.19 20 Recommendations for ratios 1:1– 1:2 for transfusions are different from previously proposed protocols with ratios of 6:4:1 or 4:4:1 as in the CMQCC Obstetric Hemorrhage Toolkit and from other obstetrics societies.21 ACOG recommends admin- istration of blood products in 1:1:1 ratio mimicking whole blood replacement.22 Massive transfusion means requirements of ≥4 PRBC units (some articles considered ≥10 PRBC within 24 h) replacement of total blood volume within 24 h or replacement of 50% of blood volume within 3 h.10 The protocol for massive transfusion is spe- cific at each institution but some schemes have been suggested in the literature. Once the massive transfusion protocol has been activated the blood bank will send blood products in rounds to the operating or labor room. Each round has a specific number of PRBC FFP PLTand cryoprecipitate units according to the protocol established in the institution. Typical rounds consist of 6 units PRBC 6 units FFP 6 units PLT or 1 platelet apheresis and 10 units of cryoprecipitate (Table 10).7 23 24 Unless inactivated the blood bank will prepare and send the prod- ucts for rounds 2– 4 successively and if the patient continues bleed- ing the protocol will start again from round 1.7 It is very important to notify the blood bank as soon as the transfusion requirements decrease to stop the preparation of blood products.7 TA B LE 10 Massive transfusion protocol in obstetricsa PRBCs FFP Platelets Cryoprecipitate Round 1 6 U 6 U 6 U 10 U Round 2 6 U 6 U 6 U 10 U Round 3 Tranexamic acid 1 g intravenously over 10 min Round 4 6 U 6 U 6 U aSource: Pacheco et al.

BOX 15 FIGO recommends that all obstetricians are familiar with resuscitative measures in the context of PPH including massive transfusion protocols. 48 |    ESCOBAR Et Al. 12  |  KEY STATEMENTS 1. Care bundles have been associated with improved patientoutcomes when adherence is high. The goal of the PPH bun-dle is to reduce the frequency of severe hemorrhage and improve maternal outcomes. There is still a need for good-quality research to determine whether the bundle approach will ultimately make a difference in saving women's lives from PPH. 2. In recent years new scientific evidence and the availability ofnew technologies have driven important reflections about PPH. To guarantee quality of guidelines it is important to update the evidence and base recommendations on the best quality stud- ies available. It is also essential to stimulate production of newresearch on the key themes of PPH to reduce disparities among guidelines. PPH guidelines have helped improve the care ofwomen around the world and their use should be stimulated in all scenarios. 3. The shock index indicator defined as the ratio of heart rate tosystolic blood pressure is simple to use. It has better predictiveability than other vital signs because it detects acute changes in the maternal cardiovascular system and appears as an early marker to predict adverse outcomes. 4. Evidence continues to support oxytocin as the first- line drug inthe prevention of PPH in all births. 5. Women with PPH should receive a fixed dose of 1 g tranexamicacid in 10 ml (100 mg/ml) intravenously (1 ml/min) as soon as possible after delivery and no more than 3 h after birth. A sec-ond dose of 1 g should be given intravenously if bleeding con- tinues after 30 min or restarts within 24 h of the first dose. Tranexamic acid should be given in addition to usual treatments for the management of PPH including medical (uterotonics)  nonsurgical and surgical interventions regardless of the cause of hemorrhage or the mode of delivery. 6. The nonpneumatic antishock garment (NASG) is an effectivenonsurgical device that should be in every healthcare facility. The NASG when used as a temporizing measure to recover hemodynamic stability in the context of PPH decreases mor- bidity mortality and hypovolemic shock and is of special impor- tance in LMICs. While considerable research is still necessary toimprove knowledge on implementation issues professional as- sociations and national and international guidelines should con- tinue to encourage NASG use for refractory PPH management. 7. Uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) is an effective nonsurgicaltechnique that when employed rapidly by a properly trained person with a proven device in the context of quality PPH care (the PPH bundle) improves survival of women with refractory PPH. National and international guidelines should include UBTuse in the management of PPH. 8. Interventional radiology may be indicated for the preventionand treatment of PPH either before delivery in cases of known placental abnormalities and implantation or after delivery when the patient is hemorrhaging. Prophylactic catheterization of theuterine arteries with embolization can be considered an impor- tant therapeutic strategy that is safe and effective for reducing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality by controlling blood loss. 9.,"(306.84771728515625, 165.13717651367188, 551.662353515625, 112.70418548583984)","(45, 46)",1500
36,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Regardless of the compression suture chosen obstetriciansmust first quickly recognize the onset of PPH safely admin- ister uterotonics and place emergent compression sutures if needed. In the immediate postoperative period womenshould be monitored for complications such as hematometra  pyometra and uterine synechiae. Most important is the abilityof the obstetrician to control bleeding using medical and sur- gical interventions stabilize the mother and reduce maternal morbidity. 10. PPH is a serious life- threatening obstetric emergency and earlyrecognition of this condition results in better outcomes. In caseswhere medical treatment fails to control the bleeding several surgical options exist. To date no randomized controlled trialshave assessed these techniques nor compared the superiority of one to another and all the data are based on case reports and case series. Moreover the use of these methods largely dependson the facilities provided in each institution and on the care pro- viders’ skills and familiarity with the procedures. Hence an ef-fort should be exercised for better training of all care providers in these life- saving techniques. Future fertility rate following theseprocedures remains underassessed due to the lack of long- term follow- up for these cases. In the future more research shouldtarget these surgical techniques to shy away from the more morbid procedures thereby improving maternal and perinatal outcomes. 11. Damage control resuscitation (DCS) is a combination of resuscita-tion and surgical interventions with the purpose of restoring he- mostasis and normal physiology. These techniques have proven tobe applicable in obstetrics with satisfactory results controlling re- fractory PPH and an overall decreased mortality of critically ill pa- tients especially in patients in whom conventional treatment can be linked to a high risk of failure. DCS is an available therapeuticapproach for the management of severe PPH thus proper training must be widespread to implement this technique. 12. Basic recommendations for resuscitation in PPH include admin-istration of crystalloids in small boluses of 500 ml checking clini- cal signs and looking for its improvement and use of balanced crystalloid solutions such as Ringer's lactate which is preferred over chlorine- rich solutions. The target blood pressure in hypo-tensive resuscitation is 80– 90 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure or 50– 60 mm Hg for mean blood pressure. 13. In hemostatic reanimation fewer crystalloids are administeredand instead transfusional replacement is started earlier with high ratios of transfusion (1:1:1). During massive transfusionsthe target for serum fibrinogen is 150– 200 mg/dl and the usual dose of cryoprecipitate is 10 units it is estimated that these will raise the serum fibrinogen by 100 mg/dl. The protocol for mas-sive transfusion is specific at each institution. Physicians shouldbe familiar with their hospitals’ protocol and recommendations. |  49 ESCOBAR Et Al. 14. Anyone who attends a birth can be taught simple home- based life-saving skills. The evidence- based prevention and management ofPPH can be achieved with the use of relatively inexpensive drugs. Women should be monitored closely during the first hour after de- livery of the baby and placenta and accurate blood loss measure- ment should be implemented. Barriers and gaps can be addressedthrough providing an enabling environment through supportive policies designing a formal plan for supplies task shifting strategies  and use of guidelines and protocols for successful implementation. 15. Simulation training on how to manage PPH is encouraged andeach hospital should have a protocol on the management of PPH. OBGYN societies should lobby to have the essential medi-cations that are needed to prevent and treat PPH readily avail- able in all maternity centers. 50 |    ESCOBAR Et Al. 13  |  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIGO RECOMMENDATIONS BY HEALTH SYSTEMS AND NATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE 1. FIGO must lobby and work with other international organi-zations to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity due to PPH. 2. FIGO recommends that all national societies work in collaborationwith nurses and midwives to lobby with their respective regional and national organizations to promote and implement these recommendations. 3. All OBGYN societies in conjunction with other healthcare socie-ties must endorse a strategy for effective prevention and treat- ment of PPH. 4. All national societies must lobby with their local nationalgovernments to establish a PPH bundle approach and make the medical supplies and surgical equipment needed for the management of PPH readily available in all regions of their countries. 5. All health systems are obligated to provide respectful care of thewoman the infant and the associated family. Health systemsmust provide the appropriate and effective medications water  oxygen equipment training and transfer mechanisms to save the lives of women and newborns.

Justificación y definición1.1 Justificación Es un hecho reconocido a nivel mundial que la oportunidad y la calidad de la atención en el manejo de la hemorragia obstétrica son fundamentales para disminuir las com- plicaciones y la mortalidad. Las principales razones para la alta mortalidad asociada a hemorragia son: la demora en el reconocimiento de la hipovolemia falla en el reem- plazo adecuado del volumen y demora en la intervención quirúrgica (1). La mortalidad materna es de 400 por 100.000 nacidos vivos lo que significa 529.000 muertes por año. De estas muertes aproximadamente 150.000 son debidas a hemorra- gias obstétricas la mayoría por hemorragia posparto (HPP) que en muchos países es la primera o segunda causa de mortalidad materna (1-3). En Bogotá D. C. en 2012-2013 esta pérdida de sangre fue la primera causa de mortali- dad materna: 12 casos (29%) en el 2012 7 casos (29%) en el 2013 (2). El “código rojo” consiste en crear un esquema de trabajo organizado de tal manera que cuando se presente una hemorragia obstétrica le permita al equipo asistencial seguir los pasos indicados sin desviarse del objetivo trabajar de manera ordenada y coordi- nada y que pueda ser replicado en cada situación específica logrando así disminuir la morbimortalidad generada por esta causa (nivel de evidencia 3 grado de recomendación C) (1 4). 1.2 Niveles de evidencia y grados de recomendación (clasificación de Oxford) (5) Niveles de evidencia 1++ Metaanálisis de alta calidad revisiones sistemáticas de ensayos clínicos o ensayos clínicos de alta calidad con muy poco riesgo de sesgo. 1+ Metaanálisis bien realizados revisiones sistemáticas de ensayos clínicos o ensayos clínicos bien realizados con poco riesgo de sesgos. 1- Metaanálisis revisiones sistemáticas de ensayos clínicos o ensayos clínicos con alto riesgo de sesgos. 2++ Revisiones sistemáticas de alta calidad de estudios de cohortes o de casos y controles.

Guía de hemorragia posparto - Código Rojo 5 2.3 Población objeto Todas las mujeres gestantes o en puerperio atendidas en Bogotá que presenten hemo- rragia obstétrica. 3. Factores de riesgo clasificación del choque hipovolémico etiología3.1 Etiología y factores de riesgo Aproximadamente dos terceras partes (66%) de los casos de hemorragia posparto no tienen un factor de riesgo conocido por este motivo es indispensable aplicar las medi- das preventivas a toda la población obstétrica. Una adecuada atención prenatal puede identificar a aquellas pacientes que tienen uno o más factores de riesgo para presentar hemorragia posparto (tablas 1 y 2) (4). Tabla 1.

Guía de hemorragia posparto - Código Rojo 7 3.3 Diagnóstico y clasificación del choque hipovolémico El diagnóstico del choque es muy fácil en los casos extremos pero puede ser difícil en sus fases iniciales. Se calcula que la cantidad de sangre perdida puede ser subestimada hasta en un 50% por lo que se recomienda clasificar el choque de acuerdo con el peor parámetro encontrado (no se recomienda hacerlo solo de acuerdo con la percepción subjetiva de la pérdida sanguínea) (nivel de evidencia 2 grado de recomendación B) (7).,"(107.71249389648438, 337.73248291015625, 461.5550537109375, 178.04588317871094)","(4, 7)",1480

Maximum single dose oxytocin doses should be 3 IU IV rapid injection or 10 IU intramuscular 3. In cases of severe obstetrical hemorrhage the calculated maximum allowable blood loss and lab-based (or point-of- careebased) factor replacement should guide treatment whenever possible. 4. Misoprostol should only be used sublingually or orally for the prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. KEY MESSAGES 1. Reducing the risk of postpartum hemorrhage begins antenatally and continued vigilance is needed throughout labour to recognize abnormal postpartum bleeding early. 2. Appropriate recognition and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage can prevent serious morbidity while reducing costs to the health care system by minimizing costly interventions and length of hospital stays. 3. Simulation training followed by formal debrieﬁng will improve outcomes in the clinical setting. ABSTRACT Objective: This guideline aims to provide evidence for prevention recognition and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage including severe hemorrhage leading to hemorrhagic shock. Target population: All pregnant patients. Beneﬁts harms and costs: Appropriate recognition and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage can prevent serious morbidity while reducing costs to the health care system by minimizing more costly interventions and length of hospital stays. Evidence: Medical literature PubMed ClinicalTrials.gov the Cochrane Database and grey literature were searched for articles published between 2012 and 2021 on postpartum hemorrhage uterotonics obstetrical hemorrhage and massive hemorrhage protocols. Validation methods: The authors rated the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. See online Appendix A (Tables A1 for deﬁnitions and A2 for interpretations of strong and conditional [weak] recommendations). Intended Audience: All members of the health care team who care for labouring or postpartum women including but not restricted to nurses midwives family physicians obstetricians and anesthesiologists. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. An individualized risk assessment for postpartum hemorrhage should be documented in a checklist upon arrival to a labour unit and updated throughout labour and delivery (strong high). The riskassessment should include a calculation of the maximum allow- able blood loss (good practice point). 2. Both antenatal and postnatal anemia should be identiﬁed and treated aggressively (strong high). 3.,"(164.40939331054688, 214.4168701171875, 546.6336059570312, 699.2012329101562)","(1, 2)",1485

INTRODUCTION P ostpartum hemorrhage (PPH) continues to be a sig- niﬁcant contributor to maternal morbidity and mor- tality even in developed countries.1 Between 2003 and 2010 the incidence of PPH in Canada was 5.6 per 100 deliveries. International data from high resource countries suggest the rate is closer to 10% when blood loss is actually measured 2and this rate continues to rise with uterine atony being the primary cause.3 4 The traditional deﬁnition of blood loss as 500 mL with vaginal delivery or 1000 mL with cesarean delivery (CD) is no longer sufﬁcient as visual estimates have been found to be inaccurate even for experienced pro- viders.5 6 In addition many women of reproductive age maintain normal vital signs despite blood loss beyond these amounts. Since these factors can lead to delays in treatment causing adverse maternal outcomes 7 8 accurate and cumu- lative measurement of blood loss has emerged as the new standard of care.9Prevention is key to reducing maternal morbidity from PPH as 60% of these patients have at least one identiﬁable antepartum or intrapartum risk factor.10 Assessment for these risk factors as well as early intervention are integral to mitigating potential adverse outcomes. This guideline provides a new approach to the early identiﬁcation and management of PPH. Recommenda- tions are based on emerging data that highlight the suc- cesses of obstetrical hemorrhage toolkits and care bundles in reducing maternal morbidity and mortality. The California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative implemented a quality improvement initiative that led to a reduction in PPH of 20.8% compared with 1.2% in non- participating hospitals.11 This guideline presents an adapted model to prevent and manage PPH and com- prises the following categories: 1.

46,Guideline No. 431 Postpartum Hemorrhage and Hemorrhagic Shock,RESUSCITATE6. REVIEWRISK ASSESSMENT Causes and Risk Factors The four Ts (tone tissue trauma thrombin) are well known. Evaluation of risk factors in each of these cate- gories is important to determine a potential cause of PPH (Table 1). Individualized risk should be documented in a checklist upon arrival to a labour unit and updated throughout labour and delivery (Appendix B). Patients at high risk for PPH deliver in a facility with easy access to a massive hemorrhage protocol (MHP) that takes into consideration local blood product supply transport and access to specialist advice. Anemia Women with anemia (Hb <110 g/L) have less reserve to cope with PPH. Anemia may also reduce oxygen delivery to myometrial muscles resulting in uterine atony.12 In addition iron is a necessary cofactor for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in muscle cells and iron deﬁciency itself may contribute to uterine atony.13Iron deﬁciency anemia is a signiﬁcant health problem for women worldwide.14 The prevalence of iron deﬁciency anemia in pregnancy is estimated at 41% with higher rates in low socioeconomic populations.14 A study conducted in Toronto Canada of pregnant women screened for iron deﬁciency anemia found that 91% of participants were iron deﬁcient (ferritin <50 mg/L) with most having severe iron deﬁciency with a ferritin < 20 mg/L despite only 25% of participants having a hemoglobin level <110 g/L.15 These ﬁndings highlight the fact that by the time a low hemoglobin is detected the iron deﬁciency is profound. Both hemo- globin and ferritin should be measured antenatally. Anemia and iron deﬁciency should be assessed and treated at or before 28 weeks gestation. Ferrous salts taken daily or every other day on an empty stomach is the ideal method of iron supplementation.16 There is insufﬁcient evidence to routinely co-administer ascorbic acid (vitamin C).17 Intravenous iron should be given if there is no response (increase in Hb of 10 g/L) within 2 weeks.18Postpartum anemia contributes to fatigue postpartum depression poor bonding and poor lactation.19 20 Oral iron supplementation should continue for at least 3 months postpartum and intravenous (IV) iron considered with hemoglobin <80 g/L regardless of symptoms.16 ABBREVIATIONS CD cesarean delivery MABL maximum allowable blood loss MHP massive hemorrhage protocol PPH postpartum hemorrhage TXA tranexamic acid 1296 l DECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022 SOGC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE For personal use only.

RISK REDUCTION The California Collaborative found that underestimating blood loss and relying on vital signs led to health care providers underestimating the severity of PPH and more importantly led to delays in treatment.11 Denial is delay should be the new theme for PPH management strate- gies.11 The beneﬁt of one or more PPH bundles (con- taining key medications instruments tamponade devices sponges sutures etc.) can decrease the time to treatment by having all potentially needed materials readily available. Accurate Measurement of Blood Loss Since visual estimates grossly underestimate the true volume of blood loss it is recommended that labour units begin to accurately monitor and record ongoing bleeding. Dry weights of sponges towels sheets and other commonly soaked surfaces should be recorded on a standard form thatcan be accessed at any time to properly evaluate blood loss in any patient. Measuring amniotic ﬂuid in the drape (cali- brated cones are available) and wiping the ﬂuid off the ﬂoor before active bleeding begins will distinguish it from any postpartum bleeding. Whenever possible suction the am- niotic ﬂuid at CD prior to delivering the infant and docu- ment its volume. Everything suctioned after this point should be considered blood loss. Sponges towels and drapes should be collected and weighed. A record of cu- mulative blood loss for the ﬁrst 24 hours should be kept. Estimated blood loss should be replaced by quantitative (measured) blood loss (Appendices C D E F).

47,Guideline No. 431 Postpartum Hemorrhage and Hemorrhagic Shock,Since that time delayed cord clamping has become the standard of care as it improves neonatal outcomes without increasing the incidence of PPH.23Furthermore in multiple trials and reviews controlled cord traction has been shown to only decrease the length of the third stage by 4-6 minutes and blood loss by <30 mL.24e28 Since there is limited evidence to suggest that expediting delivery of the placenta before 30 minutes reduces the risk of PPH in an uncomplicated delivery 22 the deﬁnition of active management of the third stage of labour should be conﬁned to the use of a uterotonic. Providers choosing to employ controlled cord traction should only do so after signs of placental separation and traction should be performed with uterine contraction as these measures reduce the risk of uterine inversion cord avulsion and partial detachment of the placenta. Although prophylaxis with oxytocin for all patients has been common practice a 2019 Cochrane review found no clear beneﬁt to routine uterotonics in terms of PPH or hemo- globin in women at low risk of PPH based on low quality evidence.29 They concluded that women at low risk for PPH should be given the necessary information regarding the beneﬁts and risks of active management of the third stage of labour in order to make informed choices about their care. Skin to skin contact may independently reduce the length of the third stage.30Oxytocin Free Interval Prior to Cesarean Delivery The longer oxytocin is used for the induction or augmentation of labour the less responsive the uterus becomes to it. Tran et al. showed a statistically signiﬁcant association between the length of the oxytocin free interval prior to CD and the total estimated blood loss with the greatest beneﬁt after 1 hour.31 While the reduction in blood loss in patients with a low BMI was not clinically signiﬁcant (7 mL/10-min recovery interval) the greatest beneﬁt was seen in women with a BMI >40 kg/m2 where blood loss was reduced by 45 mL per 10-minute recovery interval up to a maximum of 450 mL at 99 minutes. In these women higher amounts and longer durations of oxytocin use were associated with an increased need for a second-line uterotonic agent. When maternal and fetal conditions are stable providing an oxytocin wash-out in- terval may be beneﬁcial particularly when the patient’s BMI is >40 kg/m2. Prophylactic Uterotonics (Table 3) Oxytocin Numerous trials over more than 2 decades continue to show that oxytocin is the drug of choice for both the prevention and treatment of PPH.32 Compared with pla- cebo ergometrine carboprost or misoprostol oxytocin is Table 2.

In an elective CD (no labour) as little as 1 IU of oxytocin can achieve uterine tonus. While similar studies have not been done in the context of a vaginal birth it is reasonable to assume that the uterus will be at least as responsive after vaginal delivery than after an intrapartum CD where studies show an IV bolus of 3 IU is sufﬁcient to cause maximal uterine tonus by 4 minutes.40Interestingly a rapid IV infusion will provide the same beneﬁt at 4 minutes when approximately 3e4 IU of oxytocin has entered the circulation.41 42 In order to avoid overdosing oxytocin the infusion should be put through a pump hung as a separate mini-infusion with only 4 IU in 100 mL. At this point an infusion of 7.5e15 IU/h is sufﬁcient to maintain uterine tone ahigher infusion rate or additional IV boluses will not provide any additional beneﬁt. For high-risk patients or ongoing bleeding a second-line agent should be added. Oxytocin has known hemodynamic and cardiac side ef- fects (mainly ST depression from vasoconstriction of coronary arteries) that are seldom recognized after vaginal birth primarily because patients are not monitored to detect them and because the clinical signs are attributed to other causes. Fortunately these side effects are short lived however they have contributed to maternal death in developed countries.43 44 When oxytocin is given quickly hypotension and ST changes begin to appear after as little as 1 IU is administered but do not become noticeable until 3 IU is administered these signs are signiﬁcant at 5 IU.40 At 10 IU 50% of women will experience ST depression even non-pregnant non-anesthetized control patients.45 These effects disappear when the 5 IU bolus is given over 5 minutes. Rapid IV bolus should therefore be restricted to 3 IU or less and an IV infusion is preferred.,"(38.43670654296875, 375.0999755859375, 546.5941772460938, 642.573486328125)","(6, 7)",1495

The product monograph states that severe preeclampsia/eclampsia is a contraindication to its use however clinical trials in women delivering vaginally or by cesarean found carbe- tocin to be both safe and effective in this setting.49 50 While carbetocin has not been studied as a therapeutic agent for active PPH it should be considered a ﬁrst-line agent for prophylaxis at CD. Emerging evidence suggests the use of carbetocin may also be considered as a ﬁrst-line prophy- lactic uterotonic at vaginal delivery.51RECOGNIZE AND RE-EVALUATE It is crucial for care providers to rapidly recognize when initial measures have not adequately controlled bleeding. Failure to discern both the extent and source of bleeding will needlessly delay appropriate intervention. Recording quantitative blood loss and vital signs for every post- partum patient will help health care providers recognize when blood loss has moved between stages and can prompt intervention (Appendix G)RE-EVALUATE TONE Bimanual Uterine Compression and Bladder Emptying The basic manoeuvre of manually compressing the uterus simultaneously through the abdomen and the vagina can be life-saving and should be actively used until the phar- macologic agents take effect or surgical intervention is initiated. The lower uterine segment must be cleared of clots to allow the uterus to contract. Catheterization should be an initial step in management of PPH as a full bladder can impair the uterus’ ability to contract. Special Agents Misoprostol PGE1 is available in 100 and 200 mg tablets and can be given sublingually orally buccally vaginally and rectally. However an understanding of the pharmacokinetics of misoprostol borne out in clinical trials will quickly eliminate most of these routes for treatment of PPH52 (Table 4). The 2018 Cochrane review of all uterotonic agents found misoprostol alone was superior to placebo but inferior to oxytocin for preventing PPH however adding miso- prostol to oxytocin prevented the need for additional uterotonics.47 53 When used as an adjunctive treatment misoprostol should be given sublingually as this route offers the highest bioavailability with a rapid onset and a moderate duration of action. Doses above 400 mg are not needed and in fact 200 mg may be sufﬁcient.54 Miso- prostol should not be given rectally as this route offers the lowest bioavailability and is associated with a maximum serum concentration that may not reach clinically signiﬁ- cant levels.52 55 While misoprostol is a valuable adjunct to both prophylactic and therapeutic uterotonics the inject- able agents (oxytocin ergometrine carboprost and TXA) have a more rapid onset and may be more useful as an independent agent in active PPH. The main side effects of misoprostol which are dose dependent are shivering and fever nausea vomiting and diarrhea. Tranexamic Acid TXA is an antiﬁbrinolytic agent that inhibits the activation of plasminogen to plasmin. Given intravenously it has a half-life of 2 hours.56 Side effects include nausea vomiting diarrhea seizures deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism though seizures and thrombosis have not been demonstrated in clinical trials of PPH.57 Two separate randomized trials showed prophylactic IV TXA (after cord clamping in 1 trial and preoperatively in the other)Table 4.

All rights reserved. reduced the blood loss at CD 58 59 and 2 separate large meta-analyses as well as one randomized controlled trial showed that 1g of IV TXA given in the setting of ongoing PPH after vaginal delivery decreases blood loss rate of hysterectomy and mortality.60e62 In particular when given over 30e60 seconds there was no difference in systolic or diastolic blood pressures compared with placebo.61 TXA should be given whenever a second-line uterotonic is administered. Every 15-minute delay results in a 10% reduction of TXA efﬁcacy and immediate treatment im- proves survival by over 70% (P < 0.0001).63 Prophylactic use (in addition to a prophylactic uterotonic agent) in in- dividuals at high risk of PPH (cesarean or vaginal delivery) is a reasonable option. For a summary of special agents see Table 5. Uterotonics for Treatment of Postpartum Hemorrhage Additional agents should be used whenever the initial agent has not produced sufﬁcient uterine tone by 4 mi- nutes or concurrently with a prophylactic agent in patients with increased risk for PPH based on the ongoing checklist (Table 6). Ergometrine Ergometrine orergonovineisanergotalkaloidwhichdirectly stimulates uterine and vascular smooth muscle to contract. It can be given intramuscularly or in life-saving circumstances as a slow IV injection.64 It is a potent uterotonic but in the setting of anemia and hypovolemia ergometrine can rarelyprecipitate coronary artery vasospasm and myocardial ischemia even in patients without pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors.65 Ergometrine should not be used in patients with essential or gestational hypertension 66 or in patients on HIV protease inhibitors.47 67 68 Though undisputedly extremely effective potential adverse effects limit ergome- trine to a second-line agent. Carboprost Carboprost is a prostaglandin F2a that causes contractions in myometrial and intestinal smooth muscle cells.69 It can be given by intramuscular or intramyometrial injection but cannot be given intravenously. Its efﬁcacy is equivalent to oxytocin after either cesarean or vaginal delivery but common adverse effects including nausea vomiting diarrhea and fever limit its use to a second-line agent.34 70Loperamide should be given concurrently with carboprost to counteract its diarrheal effects. As a member of the F class of prostaglandins carboprost can cause broncho- spasm and should not be used in patients with asthma.71Mechanical Options Tamponade Intrauterine compression may control mild to moderate blood loss. The Bakri balloon was designed for this pur- pose and its use prevents the need for further non- pharmacologic intervention in 75%e95% of cases.72 73 It should be ﬁlled with 300e500 mL of sterile solution left in situ for 8e48 hours and then gradually deﬂated.

Alternatively systematically packing the uterus from cornua to cornua with laparotomy packs tied end to end may be considered however this procedure requires more experience more anaesthesia and a second procedure to remove. It may also mask blood loss and increase the risk of infection. Packing should be used as a last resort until more deﬁni- tive treatment can be initiated. A running record of accumulated quantitative blood loss and interventions should be easily accessible and visible to all members of the care team (Appendix E F H I). RE-EVALUATE SOURCE Retained Placenta Retained placenta occurs in 1%e3% of vaginal deliveries and is the second leading cause of PPH.74 Risk factors are uterine atony an adherent placenta succenturiate lobe and a trapped placenta behind a closed cervix. Internationally recommendations for manual removal of the placenta vary between 30 and 60 minutes based on studies from the 1990s showing no increase in PPH until at least 30 minutes had passed.74 The majority of placentas (95%) will deliver spontaneously by 18 minutes. A 2012 randomized controlled trial conﬁrmed a previous observational study that found patients who had manual removal of the placenta earlier than 30 minutes had less blood loss.75Similarly a large retrospective study (n >28 000) showed waiting more than 30 minutes for placental separation increased the risk of blood transfusion more than three- fold.76 More studies need to be done to be able to recommend the ideal time for manual removal of the placenta in a stable patient.,"(38.437801361083984, 206.98007202148438, 546.573974609375, 399.47381591796875)","(8, 10)",1488
50,Guideline No. 431 Postpartum Hemorrhage and Hemorrhagic Shock,Intraumbilical oxytocin (20 IU in 30 mL saline) miso- prostol (800 mg in 30 mL saline) or ergometrine (0.2 mg in 30 mL saline) as well as IV carbetocin (100 mg) or sub- lingual misoprostol (400 mg) all have similar efﬁcacy for expelling the placenta within 30 minutes of administration (62%e72%).77 78 In the presence of heavy bleeding transfer to an operating room for manual removal of the placenta should be expedited and curettage with a large curette may be needed. There is insufﬁcient evidence to recommend routine treatment with antibiotics.74Lacerations Lacerations of the vagina or cervix or disruption of a uterine scar should be ruled out by a formal examination under anaesthesia and surgical repair of the injury should be completed. Vaginal packing may be required when generalized bleeding from a deep venous plexus pre- cludes proper repair. Re-opening the abdominal incision after CD to look for surgical bleeding should not be delayed.

If still attached the placenta should not be removed prior to reversion. Prompt replacement may be attempted however hypovolemic shock occurs rapidly and the patient should be urgently transferred to an operating room if reversion cannot be accomplished immediately. Uterine relaxation with IV nitroglycerine in addition to vasopressors may be required to revert the uterus and reverse hemodynamic instability. If reversion is unsuccessful laparotomy may be required. Antibiotics and oxytocin should be given after reversion. REACT If previous measures fail to control bleeding urgent abdominal surgical exploration is required. Bimanual compression should be continued while preparations in the operating room are being made and surgery is about to begin. Uterine compression sutures (B-Lynch Cho) uterine artery ligation internal iliac artery ligation embo- lization and hysterectomy are possible interventions. This guideline is not an instruction manual for those not skilled at performing these procedures. Additional expertise should be sought urgently if the necessary procedure is beyond the skill set of the care provider. Compression Sutures The B-Lynch technique uses an absorbable suture on a large needle to create compression “suspenders ” which successfully treat intractable uterine atony 75% of the time.80 Adding a second suture can further decrease the need for hysterectomy.81 Cho square compression sutures incorporating both anterior and posterior walls of the uterus have similar efﬁcacy.82 Uterine Artery Ligation The purpose of uterine artery ligation is not to obliterate blood ﬂow to the uterus but to temporarily slow it. Key aspects include bladder retraction (to prevent traction on both bladder and ureters caused by the suture) and use of an absorbable suture on a large needle to secure the uterine artery at the level of the isthmus (or 2e3 cm below the uterine incision at CD). Ensuring 2 cm of myometrium is incorporated into the suture will bundle the uterine artery and vein and prevent complete occlusion of the uterine artery. A second suture can be used superiorly to further compress ascending branches of the uterine artery. Alter- natively if bleeding is predominantly coming from thelower uterine segment or cervical branches a second stitch placed 3 cm inferior to the ﬁrst can be used to compress descending branches of the uterine artery. This location increases the risk of ureteric entrapment and further bladder dissection should be performed. Radiologic or cystoscopic evaluation of ureteral patency is recommended. Bilateral Internal Iliac Artery Ligation Bilateral internal iliac artery ligation is extremely effective at controlling obstetrical hemorrhage (including following hysterectomy) with numerous case series reporting suc- cess rates of 75% or higher.83e85 Unfortunately bilateral internal iliac artery ligation requires more skill and expe- rience. Retroperitoneal dissection to identify the bifurca- tion of the common iliac artery is followed by ligation of the internal branch at least 2 cm distal to the bifurcation with an absorbable suture. Bilateral internal iliac artery ligation reduces pelvic blood ﬂow by 49% but immediate increased retrograde ﬂow in collateral vessels prevents pelvic ischemia. Resumption of menses and demonstration of ﬂow in distal uterine arteries in 90% of women within 6 months suggests that fertility is preserved.86Uterine or Internal Iliac Artery Embolization Embolization of either uterine or internal iliac arteries is highly effective and fertility sparing.,"(301.4921569824219, 335.448486328125, 546.59326171875, 610.3750610351562)","(10, 11)",1487
51,Guideline No. 431 Postpartum Hemorrhage and Hemorrhagic Shock,When compared with hysterectomy blood loss and operative time are signiﬁcantly less.87 88 The main drawbacks of embolization are the availability of an interventional radiology department and a patient with a stable blood pressure. If these conditions are met and bleeding is ongoing uterine artery embolization can be considered before proceeding to hysterectomy. Uterine artery embolization can also be considered post-hysterectomy for ongoing bleeding where a contributing vessel can be identiﬁed. Uterine artery embolization is particularly useful for cases where bleeding is expected to be high and/or surgical treatment is expected to be difﬁcult (e.g. placenta previa accreta severe obesity or suspected intra-abdominal adhesions). In these cases an interventional radiology consult should be obtained pre-delivery and a plan established including the possibility of pre-delivery placement of arterial balloons. Hysterectomy In cases of massive obstetric hemorrhage hysterectomy can be life-saving and the biggest risk is waiting too long to perform it. Successive clamping of pedicles without tying them until the uterine arteries have been secured will allow faster control of bleeding. Conﬂicting opinions on subtotal versus total hysterectomy preclude aDECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022 l 1303 PPH and Hemorrhagic Shock For personal use only. No other uses without permission. Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. recommendation and clinical judgment on the source of bleeding and type of hysterectomy is required.89 Abdominal Packing When surgical hemostasis has been achieved but ongoing bleeding persists disseminated intravascular coagulation acidosis and hypothermia are often contributing factors. Packing the pelvis tightly with warm moist packs and leaving them in place for 24e48 hours can provide the necessary time to reverse these factors. RESUSCITATE Resuscitation requires ongoing communication and teamwork involving the obstetrical care provider and anaesthesia and nursing teams. An algorithm including clinical signs and symptoms of PPH and hypovolemic shock and their treatments should clearly outline the re- sponsibilities of various team members in order to opti- mize maternal outcome11 (Appendix G). PPH is an active ongoing process lab results represent a point in time that has invariably passed. While formal lab tests can help tailor therapy waiting for results to initiate treatment can worsen patient outcomes.90 Most parturi- ents are able to maintain hemodynamic stability despite considerable blood loss. The recommended hemoglobin level at which to transfuse has decreased over time. In 2003 the threshold was 80 g/L and as of 2021 the consensus is 70 g/L however with many patients able to tolerate hemoglobin as low as 50 g/L this threshold may change in the future. Patients with pre-existing anemia may tolerate lower hemoglobin levels better than those with acute anemia. Current recommendations suggest that vital sign changes and accurate measurements of ongoing blood loss should trigger resuscitation efforts. Escalation of care (with or without transfusion) should occur at blood loss intervals of 500 1000 and 1500 mL (mild/moderate/severe blood loss) so the team can respond appropriately if the patient is not tolerating the blood loss. Maximum allowable blood loss (MABL)91 is an invaluable tool to customize treatment of PPH and should be calculated for each individual patient and documented on the risk assessment form. This formula uses the patient’s most recent hemoglobin level as the initial hemoglobin (Hbi) and the hemoglobin at which transfusion may occur if clinically indicated as the ﬁnal hemoglobin (Hbf) it in- corporates the patient’s weight and total circulating blood volume and provides an individualized estimate of the patient’s tolerable blood loss before transfusion shouldoccur. The equation assumes that volume losses have been replaced with balanced crystalloid. In a healthy pregnancy the total circulating blood volume is 100 mL/kg (range 90e200 mL/kg.) In obesity or volume-contracted states such as severe preeclampsia total blood volume should be estimated at 70 mL/kg.92The actual calculation is: ðHbi-Hbf Þ  Pt’s Weight ðkgÞ  Total Blood Volume ðmL=kgÞ ½ðHbi þ Hbf Þ  0:5 The following simpliﬁed and more user-friendly version of this formula can be used to calculate MABL: MABL ¼ Wt ðkgÞ  100  ½Hbi-70 ðHbi þ 70Þ  0:5 Hypotension tachycardia oliguria and altered mental status indicate hypovolemic shock and should be treated aggressively. The “lethal triad” of coagulopathy acidosis and hypothermia which occurs in hemorrhagic shock compounds the loss of volume and blood components.8(Appendix J) Initial Steps Establish the following:  Two large bore IV catheters  Frequent BP monitoring (consider arterial line)  Continuous EKG  O2 saturation monitor  Temperature probe  Foley catheter Oxygen Temperature Volume Oxygen supplementation of 8e10 L/min will slow the onset of tissue hypoxia. Hypothermia increases the risk of mortality keeping the patient dry using warmed blankets or forced air warmers and warming all ﬂuids will help maintain euthermia.93 Initial volume resuscitation should use Ringer’s lactate in a ratio of 1e2 mL per 1 mL blood loss.94 Higher volumes of crystalloid have been associated with poor maternal outcomes due to dilutional coagulopathy. At this time there is no evidence to promote the use of colloids over crystalloids as colloids are also associated with impaired coagulation. In the setting of ongoing massive hemorrhage red blood cell (RBC) administration should occur before total blood loss equals MABL. 1304 l DECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022 SOGC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE For personal use only.

Blood Products Red Blood Cells RBCs are the ﬁrst step in the transfusion process unless the patient has a known coagulation defect. Transfusing RBCs is not without risk and ongoing transfusion medi- cine trials continue to demonstrate that the decision to transfuse must take into account the potential for harm.92Patients at high risk for PPH should have a blood type and screening on admission to cross match blood if needed. O negative Kell negative emergency blood is the next best alternative to cross-matched blood.,"(301.4927978515625, 351.21539306640625, 283.6344299316406, 234.78207397460938)","(11, 13)",1438
52,Guideline No. 431 Postpartum Hemorrhage and Hemorrhagic Shock,There is no absolute hemoglobin level at which transfusion must occur but maintaining a level between 70 and 90 g/L during active hemorrhage is recommended.95Transfusion should occur when hemorrhage is unre- sponsive to uterotonic measures and blood loss exceeds 150 mL/min or total loss is rapidly approaching the calculated MABL or when the patient develops symptoms of inadequate perfusion such as shortness of breath or tachycardia unresponsive to ﬂuid in the presence of he- moglobin less than 90 g/L. Fatigue alone is not a symptom that warrants trans- fusion.96 Each unit of packed RBCs should increase the hemoglobin by 10 g/L. If 4 units of RBCs have been given and blood loss is ongoing activation of a MHP should be considered. Hemorrhage caused by uterine atony or birth-related trauma rarely requires additional coagulation factors or platelets unless the volume of blood loss is signiﬁcantly greater than the MABL and/or dilu- tional coagulopathy occurs. Hemorrhage due to placental abruption amniotic ﬂuid embolism or disseminated intravascular coagulation consumes platelets and factors rapidly and replacement may be beneﬁcial earlier in resuscitation.97 Cell salvage does not increase the risk of amniotic ﬂuid embolism and should be considered when the risk for severe PPH is high.19 Intravenous iron is an important adjuvant for a hemoglobin level <80 g/L once bleeding has settled.16 98 99Platelets Platelet transfusion is necessary if blood loss is severe or if a consumptive coagulopathy develops. During active hemorrhage platelets should be transfused at a level of 75  109/L in order to maintain a level above 50  109/L.19 There is no evidence to support a ﬁxed ratio of platelets in obstetric hemorrhage however it is acceptable to give 1 pooled dose of adult platelets (4 U platelets or 5 U in Québec) per 8e10 U of RBCs transfused in the absence of lab data and with ongoinghemorrhage.100 Each dose should raise the platelet count by 15e25  109/L. Fresh Frozen Plasma The goal of transfusion is to keep the INR <1.8. Donor plasma has less ﬁbrinogen than the 5 g/L typically seen in the plasma of healthy parturients and is not the ﬁrst choice for its replacement.19 Although plasma provides additional clotting factors most healthy women with moderate ob- stetric hemorrhage do not require these factors. However using plasma in a ratio to RBCs of 1:2 or 1:1 as a global replacement may improve outcomes in severe hemor- rhage in trauma patients particularly if timely lab values are not available. Large volumes of plasma increase the incidence of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated cardiorespiratory overload (TACO).101Fibrinogen Fibrinogen levels <2 g/L are associated with poor out- comes and direct replacement below these levels is rec- ommended. Testing for ﬁbrinogen levels when blood loss is <1500 mL is not predictive of severe PPH and routine administration of ﬁbrinogen in the absence of hypoﬁ- brinogenemia does not improve outcomes. Levels will drop more rapidly in the setting of abruption and amniotic ﬂuid embolism than in the setting of atony.94 96 97Each unit of cryoprecipitate contains 150e350 mg of ﬁbrinogen and a typical dose is 8e10 U. Thawing is required prior to use and multiple donors are required for sufﬁcient amounts which increases the risk of transfusion reactions.102 103Fibrinogen concentrates (RiaSTAP and FIBRYGA) do not require thawing provide accurate dosing and decrease both the requirement for other blood products and the incidence of circulatory overload.104 Fibrinogen concen- trates also undergo viral inactivation and removal of an- tigens and antibodies. Four grams of ﬁbrinogen concentrate is equivalent to 10 units of cryoprecipitate and typically raises plasma ﬁbrinogen levels by 1 g/L (60 mg/ kg dosing).102 103Massive Hemorrhage Protocol Originally designed for trauma patients MHP is now often used in the setting of obstetrical hemorrhage. In the trauma literature transfusing ﬁxed ratios of RBCs to fresh frozen plasma to platelets of either 1:1:1 or 2:1:1 after the ﬁrst 4 units of packed RBCs has been shown to decrease mortality.94 96 97 105 106 Therapy based on lab valuesDECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022 l 1305 PPH and Hemorrhagic Shock For personal use only.

(including viscoelastography where available [rotational thromboelastometry thromboelastography]) is superior to ratio-based approaches as it reduces the number of products transfused reduces transfusion overload and transfusion-related complications and tailors therapy to the underlying coagulopathy.107 108 The amount of blood loss that should trigger an MHP can be markedly different based on the patient’s size etiology of hemorrhage and underlying health issues (i.e. pre- eclampsia). Using a single blood loss volume to initiate an MHP may result in some patients being transfused too early and others too late. Whenever the blood loss is approaching the MABL and there is ongoing bleeding RBCs should be considered ﬁrst.94 96 97 105 106 Canadian standard of care recommendations indicate that an MHP should be able to be mobilized and products delivered within 10 minutes.109 If local resources cannot reliably meet this timeline consider initiating an MHP sooner. If the patient is stable and the bleeding is controlled after the initial 4 units of RBCs the MHP products can be returned. Coagulopathy does not occur in every PPH including massive PPH. When there is no coagulopathy there is no beneﬁt to transfusion of coagulation products. The etiology of the bleed matters as atony and trauma are less likely to require coagulation factor replacement than abruption abnormal placentation or amniotic ﬂuid embolism. Testing for coagulopathy rarely demonstrates abnormalities when the blood loss is <1.5e2 L. When coagulopathy is present in PPH hypoﬁbrinogenemia is the most common etiol- ogy 102 103 and commonly coexists with hypocalcemia.,"(38.437801361083984, 144.90286254882812, 283.6532287597656, 608.387939453125)","(13, 14)",1484
53,Guideline No. 431 Postpartum Hemorrhage and Hemorrhagic Shock,Ionized calcium less than 1.16 mmol/L (rather than routine or corrected calcium which may be normal) is the most accurate way to measure calcium status in a hemorrhaging patient and may be at least as important as ﬁbrinogen in terms of risk reduction.110 Calcium chloride is the agent of choice to replace calcium as it contains 3 times the elemental calcium of calcium gluconate and does not require liver metabolism. Fresh frozen plasma and platelets are less commonly needed but may be included in the MHP particularly after 4 to 8 units of RBCs respectively. Frequent monitoring of all these components (CBC PTT INR ﬁbrinogen ionized calcium) as well as magnesium electrolytes hypothermia and overall volume status are necessary components of any MHP. Tailoring therapy as early as feasible results in a patient-centred approach that is in keeping with the most up-to-date recommendations in transfusion medicine. Prothrombin Complex Concentrate Prothrombin complex concentrate contains vitamin Kedependent clotting factors and is indicated for reversal of vitamin K antagonists (warfarin). Apart from patients with known factor II or X deﬁciencies in which case a hematologist should be consulted there is currently no role for prothrombin complex concentrate in the treat- ment of PPH.96 97 105Recombinant Activated Factor VII Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) provides a thrombin burst and stabilizes clots and should only be administered to patients with a ﬁbrinogen level >1g/L platelets >20  109/L and a near normal pH (7.4) and temperature (35.9C). Given the absence of strong evi- dence of beneﬁt and the serious risk of thrombosis rFVIIa should only be used in PPH as a last resort and in consultation with a transfusion medicine specialist or hematologist.96 97 105REVIEW Quality care initiatives in many centres have clearly shown that strong teamwork and communication along with simulation training and debrieﬁng after any signiﬁcant PPH improve outcomes. Key components of teamwork include a process for standard and structured communi- cation effective use of clear language psychological safety where team members are not fearful of speaking up situational awareness and effective leadership111(Appendix K). Debrieﬁng after simulation led by a trained facilitator promotes improved learning outcomes and enhances future performance in the clinical setting.112 Debrieﬁng is more than feedback it is “an interactive bidirectional and reﬂective conversation ”113 which will foster better communication and teamwork in subsequent clinical sce- narios. As experiencing PPH can be traumatic care pro- viders should have a conversation with the patient and their family to explain the events and answer any questions they have. Debrieﬁng after a signiﬁcant PPH should occur and should include all involved members of the health care team as well as a separate discussion with the patient and her family. CONCLUSION Although the acute treatment of PPH is key for any single patient the ongoing review practices is most important for 1306 l DECEMBER JOGC DÉCEMBRE 2022 SOGC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE For personal use only.

En los países en vías de desarrollo el riesgo de morir a causa de una hemorragia posparto es de 1 por cada 1000 nacimientos en un periodo determinado mientras que en países desarrollados como el Reino Unido  el riesgo es 100 veces menor. Cada año en el mundo aproximadamente 14 millones de mujeres sufren de hemorragia posparto y de ellas 125.000 fallecen debido a la falta de reconocimiento de las causas y a deficiencias con el tratamiento oportuno y adecua- do (2). La hemorragia obstétrica no es solo la pri- mera causa de muerte materna sino que es también la primera causa de morbilidad obstétrica extrema (5). Las principales complicaciones derivadas de la hemorragia obstétrica incluyen el choque hipovo- lémico la coagulación intravascular diseminada y la disfunción o falla de órganos como el riñón el hígado y el pulmón. Las mujeres además se ven expuestas a los riesgos derivados de transfusiones masivas y a consecuencias como la realización de cirugías radicales como la histerectomía.

En particular la evidencia de esta sección fue adap- tada de las GPC del Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) “Prevention and management of postpartum haemorrhage” (2009) (6) y de OMS “WHO guidelines for the mana- gement of postpartum haemorrhage and retained placenta” (2009) (7) y actualizada por medio de procedimientos sistemáticos tanto para la búsqueda y valoración de la evidencia como para la genera- ción de recomendaciones. El nivel de evidencia y la fuerza de las recomendaciones fueron expresadas por medio del sistema del Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). La versión completa de esta GPC (incluida la búsqueda sistemática de información científica y la presentación detallada de la evidencia científica) así como la versión para pacientes y sus anexos están disponibles para la consulta de los interesados por diferentes medios (físicos y electrónicos) (8 9). 1. ¿cuáles son las intervenciones efectivas para prevenir la hemorragia posparto al finalizar el segundo periodo del parto? Se recomienda realizar manejo activo del alumbramiento para disminuir la pérdida de sangre materna y reducir el riesgo de hemorragia posparto. Se recomienda utilizar de forma rutinaria oxitócicos profilácticos en el manejo del alumbramiento en todas las mujeres. Se recomienda la administración de oxito- cina 5 UI o 10 UI (según la presentación de oxitocina disponible) por vía intramuscular como medicamento de elección para profi-A A A Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013 428laxis durante el alumbramiento en mujeres que tengan parto por vía vaginal. Cuando exista un acceso venoso permea- ble puede administrarse oxitocina 5 UI o 10 UI en infusión lenta diluida en 10 mL de cristaloides en un tiempo no inferior a 3 min. Se recomienda el uso de 600 mcg de mi- soprostol por vía sublingual para profilaxis durante el alumbramiento cuando la oxito- cina no esté disponible. No se recomienda la administración por vía intrarrectal. No se recomienda el uso de ácido tranexá- mico para la prevención de la hemorragia posparto. Se recomienda ligar y cortar el cordón um- bilical entre el segundo y el tercer minuto después del nacimiento en todos los recién nacidos a término y pretérmino que nazcan vigorosos. Una revisión sistemática realizada en el año 2000 y actualizada en el 2011 que incluyó siete ECC con 8.247 gestantes encontró que el manejo activo del alumbramiento redujo el riesgo promedio de he- morragia primaria de 1.000 mL o más al momento del parto (RR = 0 34 IC 95%: 0 14-0 87) (10 11). Los resultados también mostraron una reducción en la hemorragia de 500 mL o más en la necesidad de transfusión y en el uso de uterotónicos terapéu- ticos.,"(316.0743713378906, 349.1006164550781, 267.6398620605469, 716.6666870117188)","(3, 4)",1500
61,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,Asimismo hubo un incremento en la presión arterial y el vómito después del manejo activo. Una revisión sistemática que incluyó siete ECC con 5.800 pacientes comparó la profilaxis con oxitocina frente a no administrar uterotónicos. Los autores encontraron que la oxitocina redujo el riesgo de hemorragia posparto alrededor del 60% y la necesidad de uterotónicos terapéuticos alrededor del 50% (12). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó tres ECC con 1.671 pacientes evaluó el efecto de la admi-1++ nistración de la oxitocina previa a la expulsión  de la placenta comparado con la administración de oxitocina después de la expulsión de la placenta en relación con el manejo activo del alumbramiento para prevenir la hemorragia posparto (13). No se encontraron diferencias significativas en la in- cidencia de hemorragia posparto (RR = 0 81  IC 95%: 0 62-1 04) placenta retenida (RR = 1 54  IC 95%: 0 76-3 11) duración del tercer periodo del parto (DM = -0 30 IC 95%: -0 95 a 0 36) pér- dida de sangre (DM = 22 32 mL IC 95%: -58 21 a 102 68) necesidad de transfusión sanguínea (RR = 0 79 IC 95%: 0 23-2 73) uso adicional de uterotónicos (RR = 1 10 IC 95%: 0 80-1 52) e incidencia de hemorragia posparto severa (RR = 0 98 IC 95%: 0 48-1 98). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó seis ECC con 9.332 pacientes evaluó la efectividad de la profilaxis con ergometrina-oxitocina comparada con oxito- cina en el tercer periodo del parto para prevención de la hemorragia posparto (14). Se encontró que la combinación de ergometrina-oxitocina oxitocina 5 UI y oxitocina 10 UI tiene eficacia similar en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto de más de 1.000 mL (combinación de ergometrina-oxitocina comparada con alguna dosis de oxitocina: OR = 0 78 IC 95%: 0 58-1 03 combinación de ergome- trina-oxitocina comparada con 5 UI de oxitocina: OR = 0 14 IC 95%: 0 00-6 85 combinación de ergometrina-oxitocina comparada con 10 UI  de oxitocina: OR = 0 78 IC 95%: 0 59-1 04). En la hemorragia posparto de mínimo 500 mL hubo una leve reducción en el riesgo con la combinación de ergometrina-oxitocina frente a otras dosis de oxitocina (OR = 0 82 IC 95%: 0 71-0 95 combi- nación de ergometrina-oxitocina comparada con 5 UI de oxitocina: OR = 0 43 IC 95%: 0 23-0 83  combinación de ergometrina-oxitocina compara- da con 10 UI de oxitocina: OR = 0 85 IC 95%: 0 73-0 98).

Se encontró que los uterotónicos inyectables convencionales fueron más efectivos que las pros- taglandinas para la profilaxis rutinaria y que la investigación sobre prostaglandinas en el contexto de la hemorragia obstétrica debe focalizarse en el tratamiento más que en la prevención (RR = 1 32  IC 95%: 1 16-1 51). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 4 ECC evaluó el efecto del misoprostol en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto (16). El estudio concluyó que el misoprostol no es tan efectivo en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto cuando se compara con la oxitocina en dosis de 10 UI por vía intravenosa (RR = 1 34 IC 95%: 1 16-1 55). Una revisión sistemática de 6 ECC con 3.941 pacientes evaluó el efecto de los alcaloides del cornezuelo del centeno en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto (17). Se encontró que el uso de estos agentes disminuyó la media de pérdida de sangre (DM = -83 03 mL IC 95%: -99 39 a 66 66) así como la hemorragia posparto menor o igual a 500 mL (RR = 0 38 IC 95%: 0 21-0 69) y el uso de uterotónicos terapéuticos (RR = 0 25 IC 95%: 0 10-0 66). Los efectos adversos incluyeron elevación de la presión arterial y dolor después del parto que requirió analgesia. Una revisión sistemática enfocada en la efectivi- dad del ácido tranexámico en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto incluyó dos ECC con 453 pacientes y compara el uso de este agente (0 5 g y 1 g) con otros agentes o placebo en el tercer pe- riodo del parto (18).,"(70.8456039428711, 413.4523010253906, 267.65521240234375, 701.3490600585938)","(4, 5)",1450
62,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,La pérdida de sangre mayor a 400 mL fue menor en mujeres que recibieron ácido tranexámico por vía intravenosa después del parto vaginal o cesárea (RR = 0 51 IC 95%: 0 36-0 72). A pesar de los resultados los autores concluyeron que se requieren más estudios para confirmar la eficacia y seguridad del ácido tra- nexámico en el escenario de la prevención de la hemorragia posparto. Una revisión sistemática que incluyó cinco ECC con 1.163 pacientes evaluó la carbetocina como agente profiláctico para la prevención de la hemo- rragia posparto (19). La carbetocina fue comparada con oxitocina o combinación de ergometrina-oxi- tocina y placebo en mujeres con parto por vía va- ginal y por cesárea. Se encontró que la carbetocina probablemente es tan efectiva como la oxitocina en la profilaxis del tercer periodo del parto aunque esta conclusión no está fundamentada en datos objetivos ya que la heterogeneidad de los ensayos incluidos tanto en diseño como en desenlaces no permitió la estimación combinada del efecto. Dos revisiones sistemáticas evaluaron el efecto del corte tardío del cordón umbilical como com- ponente del manejo activo del alumbramiento en relación con desenlaces maternos y neonatales. Una de ellas que incluyó 29 ECC con 2.200 recién nacidos a término y pretérmino comparó el corte del cordón umbilical dentro de los 30 segundos después del nacimiento con el corte después de los primeros 30 segundos (20). Solo se encontraron diferencias en términos de la remoción manual de la placenta (RR = 0 45 IC 95%: 0 22-0 94). En- tre los recién nacidos pretérmino se encontró un riesgo de hemorragia intraventricular menor que en los recién nacidos a término (RR = 0 52 IC 95%: 0 28-0 98). La segunda revisión que incluyó 11 ECC con 2.989 recién nacidos comparó el corte tardío (definido como el corte después del primer minuto del parto) con el corte antes del primer minuto (21). No se encontraron diferencias en relación con la hemorragia posparto (RR = 1 22  IC 95%: 0 96-1 55). Sin embargo se encontró un incremento significativo en la necesidad de fotote- rapia por ictericia en los recién nacidos con corte tardío del cordón (RR = 0 59 IC 95%: 0 38-0 92). De igual forma hubo un incremento en los niveles de hemoglobina de los recién nacidos con corte tardío del cordón (DM = 2 17g/dL IC 95%: 0 28 a 4 06) aunque este efecto no persistió después de seis meses de seguimiento. 1++ 1++ 1++ 1++ 1++ 1++ Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013 430Una revisión sistemática evaluó el efecto del masaje uterino en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto  identificando solo un ECC con 200 mujeres que comparó la realización del masaje uterino después del parto y antes de la expulsión de la placenta frente a no realizar ninguno de estos procedimientos (22). No se encontraron diferencias significativas en la pérdida de sangre de más de 500 mL (RR = 0 52  IC 95%: 0 16-1 67) ni en los casos de placenta re- tenida. Se encontraron diferencias en la pérdida de sangre a los 30 min y 60 min en el grupo de masaje uterino (30 min: DM = -41 6 mL IC 95%: -75 16 a -8 04. 60 min: DM = -77 40 mL IC 95%: -118 7a -36 09). La necesidad de uterotónicos adicionales se redujo en el grupo del masaje uterino (RR = 0 20 IC 95%: 0 08-0 50). La evidencia indica que el manejo activo del alumbramiento disminuye la pérdida de sangre materna y reduce el riesgo de hemorragia pos- parto de más de 1.000 mL. El agente de elección para el manejo activo del alumbramiento debe ser  la oxitocina en una dosis de 5 UI o 10 UI aunque la vía de administración más frecuentemente usada es la intramuscular el GDG consideró importante sugerir la posibilidad de administrar la profilaxis con oxitocina por vía intravenosa cuando exista un acceso venoso permeable dado que no hay evidencia que favorezca la vía intramuscular (IM) sobre la intravenosa (IV). La consideración del uso de otros agentes oxi- tócicos diferentes a la oxitocina requiere de mayor evidencia que soporte su uso en la práctica diaria. Aunque el misoprostol no es tan efectivo como la oxitocina para la prevención de la hemorragia pos- parto puede ser usado cuando la oxitocina no esté disponible. El efecto específico del masaje uterino con uterotónicos o sin estos en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto requiere más ensayos con ma- yor número de participantes para evaluar su eficacia en estos casos. Por otra parte retrasar el corte del cordón umbilical por al menos 2 o 3 min parece no incrementar el riesgo de hemorragia posparto. 2. ¿cuál es la intervención más efectiva para prevenir la hemorragia posparto en una paciente sometida a cesárea?,"(70.84999084472656, 76.82110595703125, 526.287841796875, 120.734375)","(5, 6)",1444
63,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,En mujeres con parto por cesárea se reco- mienda la administración de un bolo de 5 UI de oxitocina diluidas en cristaloides por vía IV en un tiempo no inferior a 3 min  inmediatamente se extraiga el bebé. En mujeres con parto por cesárea se reco- mienda adicionar una infusión de 30 UI de oxitocina en 500 mL de cristaloides para pasar en 4 horas inmediatamente después de la administración del bolo inicial de 5 UI de oxitocina. Cuatro ECC que incluyeron un total de 1.155 mujeres evaluaron diferentes uterotónicos para la profilaxis en mujeres con parto por cesárea (23- 26). Se encontró que la oxitocina 5 UI por vía intravenosa lenta es la opción recomendada por su disminución de la pérdida sanguínea y la reducción de la necesidad de uterotónicos adicionales (RR = 2 1 IC 95%: 1 4-3 0). Así mismo se encontró que una dosis de carbetocina es al menos tan efectiva como la oxitocina en infusión en la reducción de la pérdida de sangre (RR = 2 03 IC 95%: 1 1- 2 08) pero su uso rutinario no se recomienda actualmente por ser más costosa y por ser aún escasa la información. Se concluyó que el uso de la carbetocina parece asociarse a una disminución en el uso de oxitócicos adicionales pero no con la disminución de la incidencia de hemorragia pos- parto (RR = 0 74 IC 95%: 0 57-0 95). Tres ECC que incluyeron 155 pacientes compara- ron los diferentes regímenes de dosificación de la oxitocina en la prevención de la hemorragia pos- parto en mujeres sometidas a cesárea (27-29). Se encontró que las dosis actuales (siendo estas 5 y 10 UI) pueden ser más altas que la dosis efectiva necesaria para prevenir la hemorragia (dosis efec- tiva 90% 0 29 UI por min (IC 95%: 0 15-0 43). DeA A 1++ 1++ 1++ 431 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorraGia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico igual forma la evidencia demuestra que dosis altas están asociadas con alteraciones hemodinámicas en las gestantes (FC = +28 Lat frente a + 52 Lat  p < 0 001 PAM: -33 mm/Hg frente a -30 mm/ Hg p < 0 001). Cuatro ECC que incluyeron 2.995 pacientes evalua- ron los efectos de la infusión continua de oxitocina en un tiempo de cuatro horas después de una dosis inicial de 5 UI (30-33). Se encontró disminución en el uso de uterotónicos adicionales (RR = 0 61 IC 95%: 0 48-0 78) mejoría de la contracción uterina inicial (DP = 2 8 frente a 2 2 p < 0 01)  y reducción de la pérdida de sangre (RR = 0 35  IC 95%: 0 20-0 63) no se encontró alteración de los parámetros hemodinámicos de las mujeres so- metidas a cesárea. Tres ECC que incluyeron 500 pacientes evaluaron la efectividad del misoprostol en diferentes dosis y por diferentes vías para la prevención de la hemo- rragia poscesárea (34-36). Se encontró que en dosis de 200 mcg u 800 mcg por vía intrarrectal  intrauterina o sublingual el misoprostol tiene una efectividad similar a la oxitocina en la disminución de la pérdida de sangre (608 91 mL frente a 673 9 mL p = 0 048) y en la disminución de uterotó- nicos adicionales (34% frente a 14% p = 0 032). Sin embargo los autores subrayan que se requieren nuevos ensayos con poblaciones más grandes con el fin de confirmar los hallazgos obtenidos. Un ECC que incluyó 90 mujeres sometidas a ce- sárea evaluó la efectividad del ácido tranexámico frente a placebo para la prevención de la hemorra- gia posparto (37). En dosis de 1 g por vía intrave- nosa se encontró una reducción de la pérdida de sangre (28 02 mL frente a 37 12 mL p = 0 000). Un ECC que incluyó 377 mujeres evaluó la efectivi- dad de la carbetocina como agente profiláctico para la prevención de la hemorragia poscesárea (38). Se administraron 100 mcg de carbetocina y se comparó con 5 UI de oxitocina por vía intravenosa. Los resul- tados mostraron que un mayor número de mujeres requirieron oxitócicos adicionales en el grupo de oxitocina (RR = 0 74 IC 95%: 0 57-0 95). 1++ Un ECC que incluyó 104 pacientes comparó una dosis de 100 mcg de carbetocina frente a 10 UI de oxitocina en infusión de dos horas en la prevención de la hemorragia poscesárea (39). El promedio de sangre perdida después de la administración de carbetocina fue 30 mL menos que después de la administración de oxitocina y el porcentaje de pa- cientes con pérdida de sangre menor de 500 mL fue mayor en el grupo con carbetocina (81% frente a 55% p = 0 05). La evidencia indica que la oxitocina es el agente de elección para la prevención de la hemorragia posparto en mujeres sometidas a cesárea.,"(316.07501220703125, 75.2113037109375, 541.5691528320312, 732.3948974609375)","(6, 7)",1465
64,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,Algunos estudios han subrayado que la dosis actualmente utilizada puede ser más alta que la necesaria para lograr el efecto deseado y por tanto estas dosis podrían producir cambios hemodinámicos im- portantes en la mujer. De igual forma la evidencia demuestra que la infusión de una dosis baja de oxitocina después de una dosis inicial reduce la necesidad de uterotónicos adicionales en cesárea  pero no afecta la ocurrencia general de hemorragia obstétrica mayor. Lo que es claro con la evidencia actual es que la adición de una infusión de oxito- cina en pacientes sometidas a cesárea electiva no afecta los parámetros hemodinámicos maternos ni durante ni después de la cirugía. Al parecer la carbetocina puede ser tan efectiva como la oxitocina en la reducción del sangrado después de parto por cesárea y en el uso de utero- tónicos adicionales no así para la hemorragia mayor de 500 mL. La ventaja que ofrece la carbetocina es la dosis única y no tener que utilizar infusiones adicionales. Recientemente la Comisión de Regu- lación en Salud publicó un estudio de efectividad  seguridad y análisis económico de la carbetocina frente a la oxitocina en la prevención de la atonía uterina y hemorragia posparto de mujeres sometidas a cesárea. La conclusión del análisis económico in- dica que el uso de carbetocina resulta 70 veces más costoso en comparación con la oxitocina. Por tanto  no se puede emitir un concepto de favorabilidad o1++ 1++ 1++ 1+ Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013 432no favorabilidad para el uso de carbetocina en la prevención de la hemorragia posparto en mujeres sometidas a cesárea (40). 3. ¿cuáles son las intervenciones necesarias para disminuir el riesgo de hemorragia grave y complicaciones en mujeres con diagnóstico antenatal de acretismo placentario? En pacientes con factores de riesgo para acretismo placentario se recomienda realizar un ultrasonido con Doppler pla- cen tario por personal calificado para identificar la localización y el grado de inserción de la placenta. Se recomienda que el ultrasonido con Doppler se realice a una edad gestacional por encima del límite de viabilidad fetal. Si se diagnostica acretismo placentario se recomienda planear la atención del parto por un equipo multidisciplinario apropiado para el manejo de la condición específica de la paciente en una institución que cuente con las ayudas diagnósticas pertinentes  con disponibilidad de glóbulos rojos plas- ma plaquetas y crioprecipitado y el acceso a una unidad de cuidados intensivos. No existe evidencia suficiente para reco- mendar o rechazar la oclusión profiláctica con balones de insuflación en las arterias hipogástricas en pacientes con acretismo placentario. Ocho series de casos que incluyeron 36 mujeres se enfocaron en las intervenciones con radiología profiláctica en forma de oclusión con balón o embolización de arterias pélvicas en relación con desenlaces como pérdida de sangre tiempo en unidad de cuidados intensivos requerimientos de transfusión y necesidad de histerectomía (41-47). Tres de estas series sugieren que la intervenciónradiológica profiláctica es benéfica mientras que una de ellas no encontró beneficios. Una serie de casos de 11 pacientes a quienes se les practicó oclusión bilateral de la arteria iliaca in- terna para el manejo de la placenta acreta reportó un 39 4% de disminución en la pérdida de sangre intraoperatoria y un 52 1% menos de sangre trans- fundida en comparación con 14 mujeres a quienes no se les realizó del procedimiento (48). Una serie de casos con 167 mujeres mostró que dejar la placenta en su sitio parcial o totalmente  sin intento de removerla se asoció con al menos un beneficio en 131 mujeres (49). La resorción espontánea de la placenta ocurrió en 87 casos con un tiempo promedio desde el inicio del trabajo de parto de 13 5 semanas. La técnica del ultrasonido resulta importante para realizar el diagnóstico antenatal de inserción anormal de la placenta y la planeación de la atención del parto. El GDG consideró que el ultrasonido con Doppler debe ser realizado por personal calificado  buscando identificar al máximo la localización y el grado de inserción de la placenta. Así mismo se consideró importante que estas ecografías se reali- cen en una edad gestacional donde haya viabilidad fetal para mejorar los desenlaces maternos y fetales. Dejar la placenta acreta en su sitio parece ser una alternativa más segura que removerla. El tratamiento conservador para la placenta acreta puede ayudar a las mujeres a evitar una histerectomía y presenta bajas tasas de morbilidad materna cuando se realiza en ins- tituciones con los equipos y los recursos adecuados. 4. ¿cuál es la intervención más efectiva para tratar la retención placentaria sin sangrado después de manejo activo del alumbramiento?

Se recomienda una única tracción luego de la administración de esta dosis de oxitocina.,"(316.0743713378906, 243.864501953125, 268.00469970703125, 547.5088500976562)","(7, 9)",1445
65,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,Si la atención de la mujer se está realizando en un primer nivel de atención y la placenta no se desprende con el manejo anterior se recomienda iniciar la infusión de 20 UI de oxitocina en 500 mL de cristaloides a 60 mL/ hora (40 miliunidades/min) y remitirla. Si la atención de la mujer se está realizan- do en instituciones de segundo y tercer nivel y la placenta no se desprende en 30 min después de administrar la segunda dosis de oxitocina se recomienda como alternativa a métodos invasivos la inyec- ción en la vena umbilical con técnica aséptica de 800 mcg de misoprostol di- sueltos en 30 cc de solución salina. No se recomienda la inyección de oxitocina o solución salina por vena umbilical para el manejo de la placenta retenida. Si después de la realización de las manio- bras antes descritas para el manejo de la placenta retenida sin sangrado no hay respuesta se recomienda hacer la extrac- ción manual teniendo presente el riesgo potencial de un acretismo. Un ECC que incluyó 50 pacientes con placenta retenida comparó el sulprostone frente a placebo para evaluar la frecuencia de remoción manual de la placenta (50). El ensayo fue suspendido antes de alcanzar el tamaño de muestra propuesto y el sulprostone fue dado al resto de las mujeres in- cluidas. Con los datos preliminares se evidenció una reducción del riesgo de remoción manual de la placenta (RR = 0 51 IC 95%: 0 34-0 86) y una disminución no estadísticamente significativa en el riesgo de la transfusión de sangre en el grupo de sulprostone. Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 15 ECC con 1.704 mujeres evaluó la inyección por vena um- bilical de agentes para el manejo de la placenta retenida como solución salina sola oxitocina más solución salina oxitocina más solución salina más expansor de plasma y prostaglandina más solu- ción salina (51). La solución salina sola no mostró diferencias significativas en la remoción manual de la placenta (RR = 0 99 IC 95%: 0 84-1 16). La oxitocina más solución salina comparada con manejo expectante no mostró reducción en la necesidad de remover manualmente la placenta (RR = 0 87 IC 95%:0 74-1 03). La oxitocina más solución salina comparada con solución salina sola mostró una reducción en la remoción manual re- ducción que no fue estadísticamente significativa (RR = 0 91 IC 95%: 0 82-1 00). La oxitocina más solución salina comparada con expansor de plasma no mostró diferencias significativas (RR = 1 34 IC 95%: 0 97-1 85). La prostaglandina más solución salina comparada con solución salina sola fue asociada con una reducción significativa en la incidencia de remoción manual de la placenta (RR 0 42 IC95%: 0 22-0 82). La prostaglandina más solución salina comparada con oxitocina más so- lución salina mostró una reducción significativa en la remoción manual de la placenta (RR = 0 43 IC 95%: 0 25-0 75). También se observó una reduc- ción del tiempo entre la inyección y la expulsión de la placenta (DM = -6 00 IC 95%: -8 78 a -3 22). Una revisión sistemática comparó el uso de toco- líticos solos o en combinación con uterotónicos  con no intervención o con otras intervenciones  en el manejo de la placenta retenida en mujeres en quienes había fallado el tratamiento con oxitocina. (52). La revisión incluyó solo un ensayo clínico con 24 mujeres y los datos sugieren una reducción en la necesidad de remoción manual de la placenta (RR = 0 04 IC 95%: 0 00-0 66) así como una reducción de la pérdida de sangre durante el alum- bramiento con el uso de nitroglicerina sublingual  (Media = -262 5 mL IC 95%: -364 95 a -160 05). √ √ √ B A 1- 1++ 1++ Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013 434La inyección por la vena umbilical de prosta- glandinas requiere de investigaciones adicionales  aunque los resultados de dos ensayos clínicos evi- dencian un impacto en la disminución de remoción manual de la placenta. El consenso de expertos de la “Guía de práctica clínica para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto y placenta retenida” publicada por la OMS (7) no halló evidencia que soportara el uso de uterotó- nicos para el manejo de la placenta retenida sin sangrado. Sin embargo este grupo recomendó la administración de una nueva dosis de oxitocina y realizar un nuevo intento de extracción por tracción controlada. Ante esto el GDG junto con el grupo de expertos consultados consideró importante subra- yar que no se debe mantener de forma persistente la tracción controlada del cordón y que es suficiente una sola tracción para procurar la extracción de la placenta retenida como coadyuvante a la adminis- tración de la oxitocina. Así mismo dadas las condiciones geográficas y la atención por niveles establecida en el sistema de salud es aconsejable diferenciar el manejo por niveles de atención.

El GDG también consideró que la extracción manual debe realizarse en una institución que cuente con los recursos necesarios para atender cualquier compli- cación derivada de un posible acretismo placentario. 5. ¿se recomienda el uso profiláctico de antibióticos cuando se realiza revisión manual de la cavidad uterina? Se recomienda administrar dosis única parenteral de cefalosporina de primera ge- neración inmediatamente antes de iniciar la extracción manual de la placenta. En caso de alergia documentada a los be- talactámicos se recomienda administrar clindamicina más gentamicina en dosis única. En las instituciones que cuenten con per- fil microbiológico se recomienda elegir el antibiótico de acuerdo con dicho perfil. Una revisión sistemática enfocada en estudios de profilaxis antibiótica después de extracción ma- nual de la placenta no encontró ensayos clínicos centrados en este tema (53). No se encuentra evi- dencia de alta calidad para el uso de antibióticos profilácticos. El consenso de expertos de la guía de práctica clínica para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto y placenta retenida de la OMS (7) recomendó el uso de cefalosporina de primera generación basa- dos en evidencia indirecta de estudios realizados en mujeres sometidas a cesárea y de muje res con aborto. El GDG consideró la necesidad de incluir otra posibilidad antibiótica en los casos de alergia documentada así como la importancia de contar con un perfil microbiológico que apoye de forma más segura la elección del antibiótico que se va a utilizar. 6. ¿cuáles son los criterios que determinan el inicio del manejo del choque hipovolémico? Para la identificación del grado de choque se recomienda la evaluación de los siguien- tes parámetros clínicos: • Sensorio (estado de conciencia). • Perfusión (color de la piel temperaturade la piel y llenado capilar). • Pulso. • Presión arterial. D √ √ 1++ D 435 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorraGia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico Se recomienda clasificar el grado del cho- que e iniciar el manejo con el peor pará- metro clínico encontrado. Una revisión de tema acerca del manejo del choque hipovolémico en pacientes con trauma indica que los principios del manejo y el tratamiento deben ser bien conocidos y entendidos. Esto incluye el reconocimiento de signos de hipoperfusión a ór- ganos vitales como hipotensión taquicardia entre otros (54). La evidencia narrativa retoma los signos de cho- que hipovolémico de la clasificación de Baskett (54)  enfatizando dos aspectos importantes: en primer lugar debido al aumento del volumen plasmático que ocurre en la mujer durante el embarazo cualquier porcentaje de pérdida representa para la gestante un volumen mayor que en la mujer no embarazada. En segundo lugar se debe tener en cuenta que las altera- ciones del pulso y la presión arterial son tardías en la mujer embarazada por tanto el estado de conciencia y la perfusión deben ser evaluados inicialmente. El GDG consideró que el estado de choque lo establece el peor parámetro encontrado después de evaluar a la mujer con hemorragia posparto. 7. ¿cuáles son las intervenciones más efectivas para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto con signos de choque? Se recomienda que cuando se diagnosti- que hemorragia posparto con cualquier grado de choque se active el protocolo de código rojo obstétrico que incluya simul- táneamente acciones en cuatro áreas de intervención: comunicación resucitación  monitoreo e investigación de la causa y control del sangrado. En la hemorragia posparto con signos de choque se recomiendan las siguientes medidas:• Alertar al personal de salud entrenado en código rojo obstétrico. • Asignar a un miembro del equipo el re- gistro de los procedimientos realizados  la administración de líquidos medica- mentos y signos vitales idealmente en formato preestablecido. • Garantizar la disponibilidad de hemode- rivados alertar al laboratorio y activar el sistema de referencia. • Evaluar sistema respiratorio. • Administrar oxígeno suplementario conmáscara con bolsa reservorio mínimo a 10 litros por minuto. En ausencia de máscara suministrar oxígeno con cánu- la nasal a 3 litros por minuto o sistema venturi 35-50%. • Se debe mantener oximetría de pulsopor encima del 95%. • Garantizar al menos dos accesos venosospermeables de buen calibre. Se reco- mienda al menos uno con catéter No. 14 o 16. • Realizar la toma de muestra de sangrepara hemograma completo pruebas cru- zadas pruebas de coagulación incluido fibrinógeno pruebas de función renal  pruebas de función hepática y gases ar- teriales. • Iniciar y continuar infusión de cristaloi- des calentados a 39 °C titulando cada 5 min la respuesta basada en los signos de choque: sensorio conservado pulso radial presente presión arterial sistólica mayor de 90 mm/Hg y llenado capilar < 5 seg con bolos de 500 mL si alguno de los parámetros se encuentra alterado. • Inserción de sonda Foley para monito- rear volumen urinario. • Mantener caliente a la paciente cubrién- dola con mantas y en posición supina. 4 C √ D Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No.,"(70.85002136230469, 75.54888916015625, 272.2503967285156, 58.18011474609375)","(10, 12)",1472

Un estudio descriptivo con una población de 103 participantes entre enfermeras obstetras anes- tesiólogos y auxiliares de enfermería reconoce la estimación visual como un método para determi- nar la pérdida de sangre y facilitar la resucitación temprana minimizando el riesgo de coagulación intravascular diseminada y reduciendo la severidad del choque hemorrágico (55). En un estudio descriptivo con 62 pacientes se encontró que el promedio de pérdida de sangre estimada fue significativamente menor que la media de pérdida de sangre medida por algún método objetivo. Estos hallaz gos mostraron que la estimación visual de pérdida de sangre puede resultar inadecuada (56). No se encontró evidencia relacionada con la eficacia de las intervenciones o los procedimientos complementarios necesarios para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto. Para la atención se deben considerar al menos cuatro componentes: la co- municación con todos los profesionales relevantes  la resucitación el monitoreo e investigación de la causa del sangrado y las medidas para contrarrestar el sangrado. Estos componentes deben ser iniciados simultáneamente para brindar un cuidado óptimo. Es fundamental alertar tempranamente al grupo de profesionales pertinente para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto. El GDG consideró importante definir una forma estandarizada de activar el protocolo de atención y adoptar el nombre de código rojo obstétrico para nombrarlo. Así mismo es importante reorganizar las acciones de intervención ante una mujer con hemorragia posparto teniendo en cuenta las con- sideraciones de la GPC del RCOG (6). Es indispen- sable estructurar un enfoque de ABC que permita  además de la resucitación la identificación de otros problemas. La urgencia y las medidas instauradas para la resucitación y el control de la hemorragia necesitan estar en la medida del grado del choque. Debe administrarse oxígeno en altas concentracio- nes sin tener en cuenta la concentración del oxígeno materno. Usualmente los niveles de conciencia y el control de la oxigenación mejoran rápidamente una vez el volumen de circulación es restaurado. Es indispensable establecer dos accesos veno- sos de buen calibre y tomar muestras de sangre para optimizar el manejo y la necesidad de terapia transfusional. Los componentes principales de la resucitación durante la hemorragia posparto son  la restauración del volumen de sangre y la capacidad de transportar oxígeno. El reemplazo de volumen debe ser llevado a cabo sobre la base de que la pérdida de sangre es a menudo subestimada (55  56). El cuadro clínico debe ser el principal deter- minante de la necesidad y urgencia de la transfusión de hemoderivados y no se debe perder el tiempo esperando los resultados de laboratorio (57 58). Una vez que el sangrado está bajo control se debe considerar transferir a la mujer a una unidad de cuidados intensivos o a una unidad de cuidados intermedios dependiendo de la severidad del san- grado. Es necesario el monitoreo médico continuo y el registro de los parámetros en el tiempo sugerido en formatos preestablecidos los cuales darán a los profesionales que intervienen en el manejo de la mujer señales visuales adecuadas sobre su evolución clínica. 3 3 437 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorraGia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico 8. ¿cuáles son las medidas más efectivas para la recuperación del volumen sanguíneo en el manejo del choque hipovolémico por hemorragia obstétrica? Se recomienda iniciar infusión de crista- loides calentados a 39 °C titulando cada 5 min la respuesta basada en los signos de choque: sensorio conservado llenado capilar < 5 seg pulso radial presente y presión arterial sistólica mayor de 90 mm/ Hg con bolos de 500 mL si alguno de los parámetros se encuentra alterado. Se recomienda utilizar soporte vasopresor si  la paciente continúa con inestabilidad hemo dinámica después de la reposi- ción de volumen y control del sitio de sangrado. La selección del vasopre- sor dependerá de los medicamentos  y la vía de acceso disponibles. Una revisión sistemática de 1988 actualizada en el 2011  que incluyó 38 ECC con un total de 10.842 pacientes evaluó el uso de la albúmina en la recupe- ración del volumen de pacientes críticamente enfer- mos (59 60). La mortalidad se estimó en un 18%. El riesgo estimado de mortalidad con la administración de albúmina fue (RR = 1 05 IC 95%: 0 95-1 16). Una revisión sistemática de 65 ECC con 11.549 pacientes comparó la efectividad de los cristaloides y los coloides en la resucitación y recuperación del volumen circulante en pacientes críticamente en- fermos (61).,"(70.29879760742188, 45.69232177734375, 267.6441955566406, 731.9596557617188)","(12, 13)",1360
68,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,El riesgo de muerte para las diferentes intervenciones comparadas fue el siguiente: 23 en- sayos compararon albúmina o fracción proteica en plasma (RR = 1 01 IC 95%: 0 92-1 10) 17 ensayos compararon hidroxietil almidón (Hydroxyethyl starch) (RR = 1 18 IC 95%: 0 96-1 44) 11 ensayos com- pararon gelatina modificada (RR = 0 91 IC 95%: 0 49-1 72) nueve ensayos compararon dextrano (RR = 1 24 IC 95%: 0 94-1 65) ocho ensayos compararon dextrano en cristaloides hipertónicos (RR = 0 88 IC 95%: 0 74-1 05). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 23 ensayos clínicos y 3.212 pacientes evaluó el uso de 11 diferentes vasopresores en el manejo del choque hipovolémico (62). No se encontraron diferencias en términos de la mortalidad (RR = 0 95 IC 95%: 0 87-1 03) sin embargo fueron observadas más arritmias en los pacientes tratados con dopamina cuando se compararon con norepinefrina (RR = 0 43 IC 95%: 0 26-0 69). El uso de la albúmina y de coloides para el ma- nejo de la hemorragia posparto no se recomienda porque aunque no se encuentra evidencia directa en la obstetricia se considera que el manejo del choque hipovolémico puede no diferir entre pacientes con condiciones específicas y variadas. Según esto el riesgo de muerte de una mujer en el posparto con la administración de coloides puede ser similar al reportado en otro tipo de pacientes. Aunque no existe evidencia de la cantidad de volumen por transfundir la GPC del RCOG (6) propone un volumen total de 3 5 litros. El GDG y el grupo de expertos consultados consideró que iniciar con volúmenes altos sin hacer una medición frecuente de los cambios en los parámetros clínicos puede acarrear consecuencias en la recuperación de la mujer con choque hipovolémico por este motivo  se sugirió la evaluación cada 5 min de la respuesta a la infusión de cristaloides para determinar la continuidad en la infusión de los mismos. Probablemente la elección de un vasopresor en pacientes con choque no influye sobre el resultado más allá del efecto mismo del vasopresor. Ante esta evidencia el GDG consideró que se pueden utilizar vasopresores una vez se halla verificado una adecua- da reposición de volumen y un control adecuado del sitio del sangrado pero sin que su uso retrase la implementación de otras medidas o una remisión a un nivel de mayor complejidad. Seleccionar uno u otro vasopresor dependerá de la disponibilidad de los mismos de la vía de acceso disponible para su administración y del entrenamiento del personal que lo vaya a utilizar. √ √ 1++ 1++ 1++ Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013 4389. ¿cuáles son las intervenciones más efectivas para el control de la hemorragia por atonía uterina? Para el control de hemorragia por atonía uterina se recomienda excluir otras causas de hemorragia posparto como retención de fragmentos de placenta o membranas  laceraciones o hematomas vaginales o cer- vicales ruptura uterina hematomas de li- gamentos sangrado extragenital inversión uterina o coagulopatía. Se recomienda utilizar la nemotecnia de las 4 “T”: Tono Trauma Tejido y Trombina (coagulopatía). Si la causa de la hemorragia es la atonía uterina se recomienda implementar las siguientes medidas hasta que cese el san- grado o se defina la necesidad de otra in- tervención: • Inserción de una sonda Foley para eva- cuar la vejiga. • Compresión uterina bimanual. • Administrar 5 UI de oxitocina por vía IVlenta mientras se inicia una infusión de 30 UI de oxitocina diluida en 500 mL de cristaloides para pasar en 4 horas. • Ergometrina 0 2 mg por vía IM. Repetiruna sola dosis adicional después de 20 min. Puede continuarse 0 2 mg cada 4 a 6 horas máximo 5 ampollas en 24 horas (contraindicada en mujeres con hipertensión). Se recomienda utilizar misoprostol 800 mcg por vía sublingual solo si no se cuenta con oxitocina o maleato de metilergono- vina para el manejo de la hemorragia pos- parto. El ácido tranexámico en dosis de 1 g por vía IV se puede ofrecer como un tratamiento para la hemorragia posparto si: la admi-nistración de la oxitocina seguida de las opciones de tratamiento de segunda línea y el misoprostol no han logrado detener la hemorragia o como complemento a la sutura de traumatismos del canal del par- to identificados como causa del sangrado (desgarros del canal del parto). No se recomienda el uso de carboprost para el tratamiento de las mujeres con hemo- rragia posparto. Una revisión sistemática de 3 ECC con 462 pacien- tes evaluó diferentes medidas para el tratamiento de la hemorragia posparto con misoprostol (63). Dos ensayos compararon misoprostol 600 mcg y 1.000 mcg frente a placebo.,"(70.83897399902344, 398.1509094238281, 512.8590087890625, 731.9558715820312)","(13, 14)",1422
69,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,El uso del misopros- tol no se asoció con una reducción significativa en la mortalidad materna (RR = 7 24 IC 95%: 0 38-138 6) la indicación de histerectomía (RR = 1 24 IC 95%: 0 04-40 78) el uso adicional de uterotónicos (RR = 0 98 IC 95%: 0 78-1 24) la necesidad de transfusión de sangre (RR = 1 33  IC 95%: 0 81-2 18) y la evacuación de productos retenidos (RR = 5 17 IC 95%: 0 25-107). Un ensayo mostró mejor respuesta clínica al miso- prostol rectal comparado con una combinación de syntometrina y oxitocina. No se encontraron ensayos con técnicas quirúrgicas intervenciones radiológicas o drogas hemostáticas para manejo después de uterotónicos. Dos series de casos que incluyeron 263 pacientes relacionadas con la efectividad del carboprost fren- te a otros agentes uterotónicos mostraron éxito en el control de la hemorragia posparto (64 65). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 3 ECC con 122 pacientes evaluó el uso del misoprostol en el tratamiento de la hemorragia posparto así como su vía y dosis óptima (66). Las vías de administración potenciales para el misoprostol incluyen la oral la sublingual la rectal o una combinación de estas. La dosis por vía oral no puede exceder los 600 mcg por el riesgo de hiperpirexia. Un régimen de 200√ B B B D D 1++ 3 1+ 439 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorraGia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico mcg oral más 200 a 400 mcg sublingual o rectal parecieran ser buenas opciones. Para la pérdida de sangre de 500 mL o más el riesgo relativo del misoprostol comparado con placebo fue 0 57 (IC 95%: 0 34-0 96). Un ECC que incluyó 1.422 mujeres con parto por vía vaginal y diagnóstico de hemorragia posparto por atonía uterina evaluó la efectividad de 600 mcg de misoprostol en adición a la oxitocina compa- rados con placebo (67). La proporción de mujeres con pérdidas de sangre superiores a los 500 mL o más en 60 min fue similar en ambos grupos (RR = 1 02 IC 95%: 0 79-1 32). Dos ECC con 1.787 mujeres compararon el miso- prostol en dosis de 800 mcg como medicamento de primera línea frente a la infusión de 40 UI de oxi- tocina en el tratamiento de la hemorragia posparto (68 69). En el primer estudio el sangrado fue con- trolado 20 min posterior al inicio del tratamiento asignado en 363 mujeres del grupo de misoprostol y 360 del grupo de oxitocina (RR = 0 99 IC 95%: 0 95-1 04). En el segundo ensayo se encontraron cifras de 440 mujeres del grupo de misoprostol y 468 mujeres del grupo de oxitocina para el mismo desenlace (RR = 0 94 IC 95%: 0 91-0 98). Un ECC que incluyó 144 mujeres en las que se administraron 4 g de ácido tranexámico en una hora y luego infusión de 1 g por hora por seis horas  comparado con placebo evaluó este medicamento como alternativa en el tratamiento de la hemorragia posparto (70). La pérdida de sangre fue menor en el grupo del ácido tranexámico (173 mL frente a 221 mL p = 0 041). Un ensayo clínico en el que participaron 1.964 mujeres con parto por vía vaginal evaluó el masaje uterino solo frente a la administración de 10 UI de oxitocina por vía IM frente a la combinación de ambas intervenciones (71). La frecuencia de pér- dida igual o superior a 300 mL de sangre fue mayor en el grupo de masaje solo frente a la combinación de masaje y oxitocina (RR = 1 88 IC 95%: 1 29- 2 74) o con la oxitocina sola (RR = 1 71 IC 95%: 1 11-2 61). El tratamiento debe estar acompañado por un examen clínico cuidadoso para comprobar que el útero en efecto está atónico y que las otras fuentes de sangrado tales como traumas y laceraciones genitales o inversión uterina han sido excluidas. La compresión uterina bimanual y el vaciamiento de la vejiga para estimular la contracción uterina repre- sentan la primera línea de manejo de la hemorragia posparto así como la compresión de la aorta que como medida temporal pero efectiva permite lograr tiempo en la resucitación con la reposición de volumen y en la elección del soporte quirúrgico apropiado. Aunque no existen estudios publicados que provean evidencia para estas intervenciones el consenso de expertos de la guía del RCOG (6) y de la guía de la OMS (7)  soportan la continuidad de su uso. La evidencia no muestra que la adición de misoprostol sea superior a la combinación de oxi- tocina y ergometrina sola para el tratamiento de la hemorra gia posparto primaria. La oxitocina es preferida especialmente en mujeres con hiper- tensión previa o preeclampsia. Los resultados de ensayos clínicos muestran que el uso de una dosis de 800 mcg de misoprostol parece ser tan efectivo como la oxitocina cuando se usa para detener el sangrado posparto por sospecha de atonía uterina en mujeres que han recibido oxitocina profiláctica.,"(316.07440185546875, 260.43817138671875, 541.5692749023438, 732.33935546875)","(14, 15)",1492
70,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,El consenso de expertos de la guía del RCOG (6) sugiere una dosis no mayor a 5 UI de oxitocina por vía intravenosa lenta ya que tal recomendación está en concordancia con las guías de otras organizacio- nes. El GDG consideró importante adicionar una infusión de oxitocina que permita mejorar las con- tracciones uterinas y así lograr disminuir la hemo- rragia posparto. Por otra parte no consideró útil la inclusión de una recomendación para apoyar el uso del carboprost como medicamento en el manejo de la hemorragia posparto por atonía uterina debido a la ausencia de evidencia más consistente y de mejor calidad y por ser un medicamento que no se consigue en el país. El GDG consideró importante incluir el ácido tranexámico dentro de las recomendaciones pero1++ 1++ 1++ 1++ Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013 440ajustando la dosis y aclarando que solo se debe usar cuando los demás agentes como la oxitocina  la ergometrina y el misoprostol no hayan sido efectivos. Así mismo por la ausencia de evidencia disponible no se recomienda una segunda dosis de ácido tranexámico. Se requieren más estudios para aclarar la efectividad del masaje en el escenario de la hemorragia posparto. 10. ¿cuáles son las intervenciones más efectivas para el control de la hemorragia posparto por atonía uterina sin respuesta  al manejo médico? Se recomienda iniciar medidas de hemos- tasia quirúrgica lo más pronto posible si el manejo inicial falla. Se recomienda que este tiempo no supere nunca los 20 min. Se recomienda el taponamiento uterino con balón hidrostático (incluye condón)  como la primera opción quirúrgica para las mujeres con atonía uterina. Se recomienda administrar dosis única parenteral de cefalosporina de primera ge- neración inmediatamente antes de insertar el balón. En caso de alergia documentada a los be- talactámicos se recomienda administrar clindamicina más gentamicina en dosis única. Se recomienda dejar una infusión de oxi- tocina de 30 UI diluidas en 500 mL de cristaloides para pasar en 4 horas. Se recomienda dejar el balón por un tiempo máximo de 24 horas y retirar en sitio donde se cuente con recurso humano calificado  hemoderivados y quirófano. No se recomienda realizar taponamiento uterino con gasa. Se recomienda aplicar las siguientes me- didas quirúrgicas conservadoras depen- diendo de las circunstancias clínicas y la experticia de quien atiende a la mujer: • Suturas hemostáticas uterinas (B-Lynch o sutura compresiva modificada). • Ligadura bilateral de arterias uterinas. • Ligadura bilateral de arterias iliacas in- ternas. • Embolización arterial selectiva. Se recomienda recurrir a la histerectomía prontamente cuando las medidas anterio- res fallen o las circunstancias clínicas lo indiquen desde el inicio (ejemplo: estallido uterino). Cinco series de casos que incluyen entre uno a 16 pacientes han reportado el uso de sonda Foley el balón de Bakri el catéter esofágico Sengstaken- Blakemore y el condón como taponamientos efectivos en el manejo de la hemorragia posparto por atonía uterina que no responde al tratamien- to médico (72-76). En las cinco series de casos se reportaron como exitosos los taponamientos para el control de la hemorragia posparto por atonía uterina. Una serie de casos con cinco pacientes reportó éxito en el manejo de la hemorragia posparto con suturas compresivas a través de la técnica de B- Lynch (77). Una serie de casos que incluye tres pacientes re- portó éxito en el manejo de hemorragia posparto con la técnica de B-Lynch (78). Tres series de casos que han incluido entre tres y 14 mujeres con hemorragia posparto por ato- nía uterina reportaron la efectividad en todos los casos manejados con diferentes tipos de suturas compresivas (79-81). Una serie de casos describió 110 mujeres con he- morragia posparto de varias causas a quienes se les realizó ligadura de la arteria iliaca interna como√ C √ √ C √ C C C 3 3 3 3 3 441 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorraGia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico primera línea de intervención quirúrgica 88 mu- jeres fueron sometidas a la ligadura de la arteria iliaca interna de forma terapéutica el 39% de las cuales requirieron histerectomía (82).

Cuatro series de casos subsecuentes han reportado éxito en 1 de 1 4 de 4 10 de 10 y 26 de 29 mujeres que han sido sometidas a esta intervención (84-86). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 46 estudios observacionales o series de casos con 664 pacien- tes evaluó los porcentajes de éxito de cada uno de los procedimientos quirúrgicos para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto (87). Los resultados acumulados no mostraron diferencias entre los porcentajes de la embolización arterial (90 7%)  el taponamiento (84%) las suturas uterinas com- presivas (91 7%) y la ligadura de arteria iliaca o desvascularización uterina (84 6%).,"(316.0743713378906, 75.54901123046875, 267.638916015625, 380.0313415527344)","(15, 17)",1469
71,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,El uso de agentes farmacológicos no debe retrasar el recurso quirúrgico en los casos de he- morragia por atonía uterina. Una vez se toma la decisión la elección del procedimiento depende de la experiencia y la experticia del equipo de profesionales disponibles. Es importante tener en cuenta las aspiraciones reproductivas futuras de la mujer en la decisión de la secuencia apropiada de intervenciones. Las técnicas quirúrgicas tales como el taponamiento uterino y las suturas hemostáticas pueden detener el sangrado de forma inmediata y facilitar una pronta decisión con respecto a la necesidad de la histerectomía. La técnica B-Lynch como alternativa al manejo de la hemorragia pos- parto es invaluable y puede proveer un primer paso quirúrgico para detener la hemorragia cuando las medidas con oxitócicos han fallado. El GDG consideró importante incluir el ma- nejo antibiótico cuando se utiliza el taponamiento uterino con balón para el control de la hemorragia posparto bajo los mismos preceptos formulados en la revisión de la cavidad uterina y la extracciónmanual de la placenta. En relación con el tiempo durante el cual se debe dejar el balón se consideró que un máximo de 24 horas puede ser adecuado en ausencia de evidencia clara sobre este tópico. La histerectomía no se debe retrasar hasta que la mujer esté in extremis o mientras se intentan pro- cedimientos menos definitivos si el obstetra tiene menos experiencia en ellos. 11. ¿cuál es el mejor tipo de histerectomía indicada para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto? Se recomienda que el obstetra de acuer- do con su experticia la condición clínica particular de cada mujer y las condiciones técnicas del sitio operatorio defina el tipo de histerectomía que va a realizar. Una revisión sistemática de 24 series de casos que incluyó 981 mujeres en quienes se realizó histerec- tomía posparto de emergencia encontró que la his- terectomía total fue más común en las mujeres que tenían adherencia anormal de la placenta (88). La morbilidad materna reportada en cuatro estudios no mostró diferencias significativas entre la histe- rectomía subtotal (16 de 98) y total (15 de 49) (Z = 1 74 p = 0 08). El daño del tracto urinario fue la complicación más frecuente cuando se realizó histerectomía total comparada con subtotal pero esta diferencia no fue estadísticamente significativa (16 frente a 30% p > 0 05). La técnica subtotal de histerectomía es la cirugía de elección en muchos casos hay menos trauma en el cérvix y en el segmento inferior. Aunque no se encuentra diferencia en la morbilidad materna entre la histerectomía total y subtotal el daño del tracto urinario fue la complicación reportada con más frecuencia cuando se realizó histerectomía total comparada con la subtotal. Se considera que la experticia del clínico cobra relevancia en esta intervención ya que ante una hemorragia y un útero3 2+ D 2+ Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013 442aumentado de tamaño la probabilidad de que una histerectomía sea total o subtotal dependerá de otros factores adicionales. 12. ¿cuáles son las intervenciones más efectivas para el control de la hemorragia posparto por acretismo placentario? Si la placenta no se separa con las medi- das habituales se recomienda no intentar separarla y remitir a una institución con capacidad resolutiva. El manejo médico o la histerectomía con placenta in situ están asociados con menor pérdida sanguínea que la separación. Si la placenta se separa parcialmente se re- comienda que la porción desprendida sea extraída y la hemorragia que se presente sea manejada de acuerdo con las recomen- daciones planteadas. Las porciones que no se desprenden pueden ser dejadas en su lugar pero la pérdida de sangre en tales circunstancias puede ser mayor y requiere el manejo de una hemorragia masiva de manera oportuna. En una serie de casos que incluyó 167 mujeres con placenta acreta en manejo expectante (definido como dejar la placenta parcial o totalmente en su sitio sin intento de removerla a la fuerza) se reportó éxito en 131 mujeres referente a la prevención del sangrado y a la realización de una histerectomía (49). A 18 mujeres se le realizó histerectomía y a otras 18 se les pudo retrasar este procedimiento por unas horas. La resorción espontánea de la placenta ocurrió en 87 casos y el promedio de tiempo desde el parto hasta la resorción fue  de 13 5 semanas. Dos series de casos que incluyeron 37 mujeres con placenta acreta que tuvieron cesárea reportan otros procedimientos como la ligadura las suturas y la oclusión en el manejo de la hemorragia pospartopor acretismo placentario (48 89). Los resultados de estos procedimientos han sido positivos en la reducción de la pérdida de sangre (2.011 mL frente a 3.316 mL p = 0 042) y en la media del volumen de sangre transfundida (1.058 mL frente a 2.211 mL p = 0 005). El GDG consideró importante la opción de rea- lizar ligadura bilateral de la arteria uterina seguida de una sutura de B-Lynch en mujeres con acretismo placentario que desean preservar su fertilidad. De igual forma la opción de realizar oclusión perio- peratoria de la arteria iliaca interna si se cuenta con el recurso para realizarla puede ser adecuada. Como punto importante no se debe intentar tratar a estas pacientes en instituciones que no cuenten con recurso humano y tecnológico suficiente para manejar las complicaciones.,"(70.84999084472656, 76.82110595703125, 541.5391235351562, 487.5491943359375)","(17, 18)",1485
72,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,Así mismo se consideró como punto funda- mental no intentar separar la placenta en lugares o instituciones donde no se cuente con personal y equipos necesarios y suficientes para atender el caso. Por tanto una remisión oportuna a una institución de mayor complejidad donde se pueda realizar la extracción de la placenta y al mismo tiempo el manejo de la hemorragia es vital para disminuir los riesgos de morbilidad y mortalidad. 13. ¿cuál es la intervención más efectiva para el manejo de la hemorragia obstétrica por abrupcio de placenta? Se recomienda que el manejo de la hemo- rragia obstétrica por abrupcio de placenta se realice en un nivel de alta complejidad  búsqueda y tratamiento activo de la coa- gulopatía (considerar protocolo de trans- fusión masiva) y soporte vital avanzado. Una revisión sistemática de estudios de interven- ción no identificó ningún ECC para el manejo del abrupcio de placenta (90). D D 3 3 √ 1++ 443 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorraGia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico Una serie de casos con 59 pacientes evalúo el manejo selectivo de las pacientes con abrupcio de placenta y determinó que la sobrevida neonatal se logra con una adecuada cesárea y con un peso fetal mínimo de 1.500 g (91). La escasa evidencia actualizada y de calidad sobre el manejo de la hemorragia por abrupcio de placenta lleva a considerar intervenciones muy generales y que indiscutiblemente van a estar supeditadas a la situación específica de cada mujer que presente el evento. El GDG consideró que en mujeres con abrupcio y feto muerto se debe evitar al máximo realizar una cesárea y se debe insistir en parto vaginal simultáneamente con el manejo integral de la situación. 14. ¿cuáles son las recomendaciones generales para el uso de hemoderivados en el tratamiento de la mujer con hemorragia obstétrica? Se recomienda realizar pruebas cruzadas en hemorragia posparto. En los casos en que las pruebas cruzadas no estén disponibles se recomienda ini- ciar con sangre tipo O negativo o sangre específica sin pruebas cruzadas hasta que la sangre específica con pruebas cruzadas esté disponible. Se recomienda en caso de choque hemo- rrágico grave abrupcio de placenta con feto muerto o coagulopatía intravascular diseminada (CID) clínicamente evidente  aplicar un protocolo de transfusión masiva para servicios obstétricos. En aquellos sitios que tengan disponibili- dad se recomienda reponer glóbulos rojos  plasma fresco congelado y plaquetas en una relación 1:1:1. En los sitios con limitación de recursos se pueden reponer glóbulos rojos y plasma fresco congelado en una relación 1 5:1. Se recomienda administrar concentrado de plaquetas si el conteo es menor de 50.000. Se recomienda administrar crioprecipitado si el fibrinógeno es menor de 1 g/L. No se recomienda utilizar algún filtro especial de sangre porque disminuye la velocidad de infusión. No existe evidencia en hemorragia obsté- trica para recomendar o rechazar el uso de factor VII recombinante. Una serie de casos que incluyó 27 pacientes some- tidas a cesárea evaluó el efecto de la autotransfusión a través de un proceso denominado rescate celular intraoperatorio mediante el cual la sangre perdida durante una cirugía es recolectada filtrada y lim- piada a fin de producir glóbulos rojos autólogos para transfundir al paciente (92). En el proceso se retiraron de forma efectiva sustancias como alfaproteína y líquido amniótico de 23 pacientes. Este procedimiento está siendo usado comúnmente en cirugía cardiaca ortopédica y vascular con  una reducción relativa de transfusión del 39% y una reducción del riesgo absoluto del 23% sin aparente impacto adverso en desenlaces clínicos. Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 45 estudios observacionales realizados en pacientes críticamen- te enfermos evaluó la eficacia de la transfusión de glóbulos rojos para 272.596 pacientes (93). Los resultados de la revisión indican que la transfusión de glóbulos rojos se asoció con mortalidad (OR = 1 7 IC 95%: 1 4-1 9). La infección nosocomial se asoció con la transfusión de glóbulos rojos en nueve estudios (OR = 1 8 IC 95%: 1 5-2 2). Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 25 ensayos clínicos con 3.503 pacientes sin hemofilia evaluó la efectividad en el uso del factor VIIa para la pro- filaxis y el tratamiento de la hemorragia (94). No se encontraron diferencias en términos de morta- lidad con el uso profiláctico del factor VIIa (RR = 1 06 IC 95%: 0 5-2 24) pero hubo disminución en la pérdida promedio de sangre (DM = -243 mL  IC 95%: -399 a -146 mL). No hubo diferencias en3 C C √ √ √ C C C B 3 2+ 1++ Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013 444el uso del factor VIIa en el número de pacientes transfundidos (RR = 0 91 IC 95%: 0 81-1 02)  como tampoco en el número de eventos adversos tromboembólicos (RR = 1 32 IC 95%: 0 84- 2 06). Respecto al uso terapéutico del factor VIIa no se encontraron diferencias para los desenlaces evaluados.,"(316.0743713378906, 182.65875244140625, 267.6243591308594, 318.8254089355469)","(18, 20)",1483
73,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,No hubo diferencias en la reducción de la mortalidad (RR = 0 89 IC 95%: 0 77-1 03) ni en los eventos adversos tromboembólicos (RR = 1 21 IC 95%: 0 93-1 58). Otra revisión sistemática de intervenciones no encon- tró ensayos clínicos acerca del uso de intervenciones hematológicas para tratar la coagulación intravascular diseminada en el embarazo y en el posparto como una de las complicaciones más frecuentes en los eventos de hemorragia obstétrica (95). Si las pruebas cruzadas no están disponibles se debe brindar la mejor alternativa para restaurar la capacidad de transporte de oxígeno. La sangre tipo O negativo puede ser el camino más seguro para evitar una incompatibilidad transfusional. Cuando la pérdida de sangre alcance alrededor de los 4 5 litros y se hayan administrado grandes volúmenes de cristaloides habrá defectos en los factores de coa- gulación de la sangre y se tendrán que administrar algunos hemoderivados. El GDG consideró que la reposición de volumen con hemoderivados para mejorar la capacidad de transporte de oxígeno y corregir los problemas de coagulación debe hacerse en una relación 1:1:1. En instituciones donde la disponibilidad de he- moderivados no es muy amplia puede hacerse una reposición en una relación de 1 5 a 1. 15. ¿cuál es la indicación más efectiva para transfundir en ausencia de sangre O negativo? En ausencia de glóbulos rojos O negativo se recomienda iniciar con glóbulos rojos “O” positivo. Una serie de casos que incluyó 4.241 pacientes evaluó desenlaces como muerte y necesidad de transfusión masiva con la transfusión de glóbulos rojos (96). Solo 1.236 pacientes los recibieron sin pruebas cruzadas. En este grupo de pacientes hubo un incremento en la mortalidad (OR = 2 15 IC 95%: 1 58-2 94) y en la necesidad de transfusión masiva (OR = 11 87 IC 95%: 8 43-16 7) pero los grupos de comparación diferían en sus condiciones basales como edad y presencia de complicaciones. Una revisión de casos que incluyó 119 pacientes evaluó los resultados de la transfusión de 568 unidades de glóbulos rojos tipo “O” positivo sin pruebas cruzadas en la resucitación de pacientes con trauma (97). No se presentó ninguna reacción hemolítica aguda o sensibilización en mujeres jóve- nes. Dentro de las 24 horas del ingreso fallecieron 38 pacientes pero ninguna muerte fue atribuible a reacción transfusional o incompatibilidad sanguí- nea. Las complicaciones incluyeron arritmias (2 casos) SDRA (4 casos) y CID (7 casos). Ninguno de los casos de CID se relacionó con incompati- bilidad transfusional. En una serie de casos que incluyó 153 pacientes con trauma sometidos a transfusión de glóbulos rojos sin pruebas cruzadas (98) la tasa de mortalidad general fue de 45% la cual se incrementó a 52 y 100% en pacientes que recibieron cuatro y cinco más unidades de glóbulos rojos respectivamente. Aunque no todos los estudios relacionan las uni- dades transfundidas con los desenlaces presentados  parece claro que a pesar de brindar una seguridad relativa la transfusión de glóbulos rojos sin pruebas cruzadas y de sangre tipo “O” positivo en ausencia de sangre tipo “O” negativo se debe limitar y con- siderar en cada caso específico. 1++ C 3 3 3 445 Guía de práctica clínica para la prevención y el manejo de la hemorraGia posparto y complicaciones del choque hemorráGico 16. ¿cuáles son los aspectos logísticos para tener en cuenta en el manejo del choque hipovolémico por causa obstétrica? Se recomienda que las instituciones de salud que atienden partos cuenten con un protocolo o guía para el manejo de la he- morragia posparto. Se recomienda que las instituciones de sa- lud de primer y segundo nivel que atienden partos cuenten con un protocolo formal para la referencia de las mujeres a un nivel de mayor complejidad. Un estudio antes y después acerca de la implemen- tación de un sistema de auditoría en el manejo de las mujeres con hemorragia posparto encontró un aumento en la calidad de la adherencia a tres estándares: tipificación y realización de pruebas cruzadas establecimiento de la hemoglobina y el hematocrito y el diligenciamiento del registro de ingesta y eliminación de líquidos (99). No hubo cambios significativos en el seguimiento estrecho de signos vitales casos de mortalidad acceso venoso administración de fluidos y oxitócicos admi nistrados. El consenso de expertos de la Guía para el ma nejo de la hemorragia posparto y la placenta rete nida de la OMS (53) considera que la imple- mentación de un protocolo formal es un proceso complejo que requiere adaptaciones locales. 17. ¿cuál es la estrategia más efectiva para mejorar las habilidades del personal de salud en el manejo de la hemorragia obstétrica? Se recomienda entrenamiento en el ma- nejo de la hemorragia posparto a todo el personal que atiende partos. Se recomienda que el entrenamiento para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto se haga bajo la estrategia de simulación. AUn ECC que incluyó 106 unidades de maternidad en Francia evalúo la efectividad de una intervención combinada de educación visitas periódicas grupos de discusión recordatorios y revisiones con pares comparada con la difusión pasiva del protocolo de manejo en la incidencia de hemorragia pospar- to (100).,"(70.84880065917969, 76.82232666015625, 512.8575439453125, 731.9531860351562)","(20, 21)",1488
74,Guía de hemorragia posparto Código Rojo FECOL,El porcentaje de hemorragia posparto fue 1 64% en las unidades intervenidas frente a 1 65% en las unidades de control por lo que no se encontraron diferencias significativas. Algunos elementos del manejo de la hemorragia posparto fueron aplicados más frecuentemente en las uni- dades con la intervención como la ayuda de un grupo de expertos o la tendencia a una segunda línea de tratamiento farmacológico y el análisis de sangre a tiempo. Un ECC que incluyó 36 profesionales de la salud evaluó la enseñanza basada en lectura comparada con la enseñanza basada en simulación o la combi- nación de ambas para el manejo de la hemorragia posparto (101). Todos los equipos mejoraron en su desempeño y conocimiento. El equipo en el que se usó solo simulación fue el único grupo que demostró mejoramiento sostenido en el manejo clínico del caso confidencia habilidades de co- municación y conocimiento. Este mismo grupo reportó habilidades transferibles y menos ansiedad en emergencias subsecuentes. Una revisión sistemática que incluyó 609 estudios y 35.226 personas de diversas áreas de la salud comparó el entrenamiento basado en la simulación contra ninguna intervención. En comparación con la no intervención el entrenamiento por simulación se asoció con el conocimiento (RR = 1 20 IC 95%: 1 04-1 35) las habilidades de manejo del tiempo (RR = 1 14 IC 95%: 1 03-1 25) las habilidades de proceso (RR = 1 09 IC 95%: 1 03-1 16) las habilidades del producto (RR = 1 18 IC 95%:D D 3 A A (á) 1+ 1+ 1++ Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología Vol. 64 No. 4 • 2013 4460 98-1 37) los comportamientos del tiempo (RR = 0 79 IC 95%: 0 47-1 10) otros comportamien- tos (RR = 0 81 IC 95%: 0 66-0 96) y con efectos directos sobre los pacientes (RR = 0 50 IC 95%: 0 34-0 66) (102). Aunque se requieren más estudios que permi- tan mostrar cambios positivos en la incidencia de complicaciones y de mortalidad a través del mejo- ramiento de habilidades técnicas comunicacionales y del conocimiento es claro que el camino hacia este propósito es el entrenamiento en escenarios de simulación y un acompañamiento continuo para el mantenimiento de las habilidades adquiridas. decLARAcIón de conFLIctos de InteRÉs El trabajo científico de investigación así como la elaboración de las recomendaciones incluidas en el presente documento fueron realizados de manera independiente por el Grupo Desarrollador de Guías (GDG) de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the available evidence on intravenous oxytocin dosing regimens for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage following cesarean delivery. DATA SOURCES: We searched Ovid MEDLINE Embase Global Index Medicus Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for eligible studies pub- lished until February 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included any randomized or nonrandomized study published in peer-reviewed journals that compared at least 2 different dosing regimens of intravenous oxytocin for postpartum hemorrhage prevention in women undergoing cesarean delivery. METHODS: Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcome was incidence of postpartum hemorrhage 1000 mL. Other review outcomes included use of additional uterotonics blood loss and adverse maternal events. Data were analyzed according to the type of intravenous administration (bolus only infusion only or bolus plus infusion) and total oxytocin dose. A meta-analysis was performed on randomized trials and the results were reported as risk ratios or mean differences with 95% conﬁdence intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluations scale was used to rate the certainty of evidence. Findings from dose-ﬁnding trials and nonrandomized studies were reported narratively. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies (7333 women) met our inclusion criteria and included 30 randomized trials and 5 nonrandomized studies. There were limited data available from the trials for most outcomes and the results were not conclusive. Compared with bolus plus infusion regimens bolus only regimens probably result in slightly higher mean blood loss (mean difference 52 mL 95% conﬁdence interval 0.4e104 mL moderate certainty). Among the bolus plus infusion regimens initial bolus doses <5 IU may reduce nausea (risk ratio 0.26 95% conﬁdence interval 0.11e0.63 low certainty) when compared with doses of 5e9 IU. Total oxytocin doses of 5e9 IU vs total doses of 10e19 IU may increase the use of additional uterotonics (risk ratio 13.00 95% conﬁdence interval 1.75e96.37 low certainty). Effects on other outcomes were generally inconclusive. CONCLUSION: There are limited data available for comparisons of IV oxytocin regimens for postpartum hemorrhage prevention following cesarean delivery. Bolus plus infusion regimens may lead to minor reductions in mean blood loss and initial bolus doses of <5 IU may minimize nausea. Bolus only regimens of 10 IU vs bolus only regimens of 5 IU may decrease the need for additional uterotonics however further comparative trials are required to understand the effects on other key outcomes particularly hypotension. Key words: abdominal delivery birth blood loss dosing drug administration pregnancy uterine atony uterotonics 250 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology SEPTEMBER 2021 Systematic Reviews ajog.org global efforts to reduce PPH-associated morbidity and mortality.4 In 2018 the World Health Organiza- tion (WHO) recommended that 10 in- ternational units (IU) of oxytocin should be administered to all women during delivery irrespective of the mode of de- livery (vaginal or cesarean delivery [CD]).4 This recommendation was informed by a Cochrane network meta- analysis of uterotonic agents for PPH prevention by Gallos et al.5 Based on further evidence from observational studies suggesting dose-dependent adverse effects 4 the WHO recommen- dations speciﬁed that when used for PPH prevention during CD 10 IU oxytocin should be administered as a divided dose using a smaller initial intravenous (IV) bolus followed by infusion.4 However the WHO Guideline Development Group acknowledged that there was insufﬁcient evidence from randomized controlled trials and speciﬁed that identifying an optimal IV oxygocin regimen for PPH prophylaxis during CD was a high research priority.4 Previous reports have synthesized ev- idence on oxytocin dosing regimens for PPH prevention during CD however none of these were systematic reviews or were published nearly a decade ago.6e8 An up-to-date review and comparison of studies are important to help guide clinical practice and address the priority identiﬁed by the WHO Guideline Development Group. The aim of this systematic review was therefore to identify and compare IVoxytocin dosing regimens during CD and determine whether any regimens are superior. Methods We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) guidance9 (Appendix A). We followed a prespeciﬁed protocol registered with the International Prospec- tive Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42020175544) 10 and outlined any deviations in Appendix B. Ethics approval was not required because this was a systematic review of publicly available data.,"(316.08282470703125, 76.8115234375, 367.6245422363281, 599.4669799804688)","(1, 2)",1473
82,Intravenous oxytocin dosing regimens,Eligibility criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) published in peer-reviewed journals were eligible for inclusion without date restrictions. Conference abstracts were not included. We included studies written in English and those written in other languages if we were able to obtain adequate translations. Eligible studies were those that included women who gave birth at any gestational age to a live or stillborn baby via CD and included both planned and intrapartum CDs. Women were eligible if they received IV oxytocin for PPH prevention either at or around the third stage of labor recognizing that admin- istration of oxytocin during the third stage may not be possible or practical during a CD particularly during an emergency CD. Studies comparing at least 2 different IV dosing regimens of oxytocin during CD were eligible. Trials with coad- ministered interventions were eligible provided that the use of cointerventions was identical in all trial arms. Outcomes of interest We prespeciﬁed 25 outcomes based on those used in the WHO recommenda- tions on uterotonics for PPH preven- tion 4 the PPH core outcome set 11 and the 2019 Cochrane network meta- analysis on uterotonics for PPH pre- vention.5 The primary review outcome was incidence of PPH 1000 mL with secondary outcomes including PPH 500 mL maternal death severe maternal morbidity (intensive care unit [ICU] admissions) severe maternal morbidity (shock) use of additional uterotonics satisfactory uterine tone use of surgical or invasive nonsurgical interventions blood transfusion mean volumes of blood loss change in he- moglobin measurements before vs after birth any adverse maternal events (including nausea vomiting headache hypotension chest pain myocardial ischemia cardiac arrythmia dyspnea bradycardia tachycardia or water intoxication) breastfeeding at hospital discharge maternal sense of well-being and maternal satisfaction. Information sources search strategy and study selection A search strategy was developed in consultation with an information specialist (Supplemental Table 1). Be- tween February 14 2020 and February 19 2020 we searched the following 7 electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE Embase Global Index MedicusAJOG at a Glance Why was this study conducted? The World Health Organization guidelines state that there is insufﬁcient evidence to recommend a speciﬁc oxytocin dosing regimen to prevent women from experiencing postpartum hemorrhage following a cesarean delivery. This sys- tematic review was conducted to identify and compare intravenous oxytocin dosing regimens administered during cesarean deliveries and to determine whether any regimens are superior. Key ﬁndings We found limited and generally low-quality data for most outcomes and further research is required. Bolus plus infusion regimens with an initial bolus dose of <5 international units (IU) may have minor beneﬁts. Bolus only regimens of 10 IU vs 5 IU may decrease the use of additional uterotonics although the effects on adverse events (particularly hypotension) is unknown. What does this add to what is known? This study compared data on all oxytocin regimens administered during cesarean delivery for postpartum hemorrhage prevention. It provides valuable information for clinical guidelines and future research. ajog.org Systematic Reviews SEPTEMBER 2021 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology 251 Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO Interna- tional Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Recovered citations were de-duplicated using Endnote (Clarivate Analytics Philadelphia PA)12 and imported into Covidence (Covidence Melbourne Australia)13 for screening. Each unique citation was reviewed and independently assessed by 2 review authors (L.C.P. E.K.F. and M.C.) for inclusion initially based on titles and abstracts and then on the full-text articles of potentially eligible citations. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or consultation with another reviewer (J.P.V.). We also screened the reference lists of all included studies in addition to the reference list of the Gallos et al5 network meta-analysis for additional eligible studies. Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias For each study 2 reviewers (L.C.P. E.K.F. M.C.) double-extracted data us- ing a predesigned and pretested elec- tronic spreadsheet (Google Sheets). Data about the study design year of publica- tion period of recruitment number of participants maternal age gestational age primary and secondary review out- comes and potential effect modiﬁers (type of CD previous oxytocin admin- istration during childbirth and previous risk for PPH) were extracted. Disagree- ments between the reviewers at the title and abstract and full-text stages were 4% and 9% respectively and were resolved through discussion or consul- tation with another reviewer (J.P.V.). We attempted to contact the study authors for all studies for which further infor- mation was required. Each included study was assessed for risk of bias by at least 2 review authors (L.C.P. E.K.F. M.C.). RCTs were assessed using the Cochrane Risk Of Bias 2.0 (ROB 2.0 Cochrane London United Kingdom) tool 14 and NRSIs were assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non- randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I Cochrane) tool.15 We made an explicit judgment about the overallrisk of bias for each included study. In addition we assessed the risk of bias of blood loss measurements using a similar approach to Gallos et al5 (Supplemental Table 2). Extracted data about the re- view outcomes from RCTs were entered into the Review Manager 5 software (Cochrane)16 for the meta-analysis. Data from NRSIs were reported narratively. Data synthesis We identiﬁed the following 3 types of studies: comparative RCTs with 2 arms dose-ﬁnding RCTs and NRSIs. Comparative randomized controlled trials. For comparative RCTs we ﬁrst assessed trial populations and methods used between trials to judge whether they were sufﬁciently similar to warrant a meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used to assess all outcomes with >1 trial.

83,Intravenous oxytocin dosing regimens,For all meta-analyses we used the Grading of Recommenda- tions Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach17 to rate the certainty of evidence as very low low moderate or high using GRADEpro software (Evidence Prime Inc Ontario Canada).18 We planned to assess publi- cation bias using funnel plots if there were 10 or more studies included in the meta- analysis however this was not done because of the limited number of studies. We conducted separate meta-analyses for (1) type of IV administration (bolus only infusion only or bolus plus infu- sion) and (2) total oxytocin dose administered. We calculated the total oxytocin dose for each trial arm by adding all preplanned doses of oxytocin described in the study methods including any doses used in a bolus short infusion and maintenance infu- sion (studies were not included for analysis of total oxytocin dose if there was insufﬁcient information to deter- mine the total dose). Considering the available evidence (and to standardize the analyses) trial arms were grouped into 5 total oxytocin dose categories (<5 IU 5e9 IU 10e19 IU 20e49 IU and50 IU) for comparison in pairwise analyses. In addition among trials using bolus plus infusion regimens we iden- tiﬁed trials that studied the effects of using different initial bolus doses by varying the initial bolus dose while keeping the infusion component iden- tical between trial arms. Hence we also analyzed (3) the effects of different initial bolus doses among trials using bolus plus infusion regimens. To accomplish this we grouped the initial bolus doses as <5 IU 5 IU or 10 IU for comparison in pairwise analyses. In line with the 2019 international consensus statement recommendation of a 2- to 4-hour maintenance infusion 8 we performed a subgroup analysis on studies that used a maintenance infusion be- tween 2 and 4 hours only. Owing to limited available data we were only able to perform this for the analysis of initial bolus doses in a bolus plus infusion regimen. We planned to conduct subgroup analyses by type of CD (planned vs intrapartum) previous oxytocin admin- istration and previous risk of PPH however these were not possible because of limited available data. We performed sensitivity analyses for risk of bias (only including studies with an overall low risk of bias) and method of blood loss esti- mation (only including studies that used calculated or volumetric assessment of blood loss). When making statements on the effects of an intervention we adopted standardized language derived from San- tesso et al.19Dose-ﬁnding trials and nonrandomized studies. The dose-ﬁnding RCTs used a 1-arm up- and-down sequential allocation method in which the oxytocin dose for the next participant was adjusted according to the response of the preceding participant.20For example if the ﬁrst participant had a satisfactory response the next partici- pant was allocated either an equal or lower dose using a biased-coin technique. Dose-ﬁnding trials did not make explicit pairwise comparisons between dosing regimens hence ﬁndings from these trials were reported narratively. Eligible NRSIs were also reported narratively. Systematic Reviews ajog.org 252 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology SEPTEMBER 2021 Results Study selection and characteristics The results of the search are summarized in the PRISMA ﬂow diagram (Figure 1). We identiﬁed 9631 records of which 6626 records were excluded at the title and abstract screening stage and 195 at the full-text review stage. The most common reasons for exclusion were duplicate study (n¼72) and wrong article type (n¼37). No further articles were identiﬁed through screening of the reference lists. In total 35 studies of 7333 women were included. We found 30 RCTs of which 26 were comparative RCTs and 4 were dose-ﬁnding RCTs. We found 5 NRSIs of which 4 were comparative and 1 was a dose-ﬁnding study. A summary of the study charac- teristics and an overview of study com- parisons are provided in Tables 1 to 4 and Supplemental Table 3. Among the 26 comparative RCTs included 9 were at an overall high risk for bias and 15 were at low risk for bias (Supplemental Figures 1 and 2) the 4 dose-ﬁnding RCTs were assessed to be at an overall high risk for bias. Of the 5 NRSIs 2 were assessed to be at an overall critical risk of bias and the remaining 3 as at moderate risk (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4). Comparative randomized controlled trials We identiﬁed 26 comparative RCTs (64 trial arms) that included 5271 women. Of these 19 RCTs were 2-arm trials and 7 RCTs were multi-arm trials (ranging from 3e6 arms). Sample sizes ranged from 28e2069 women and 23 trials included women undergoing planned CD only. The types of IVadministrations used were bolus only (14 arms) infusion only (23 arms) and bolus plus infusion (27 arms). There were 26 different total doses of oxytocin used ranging from 1 IUe260 IU. The most common total doses were 5 IU (11 arms) and 10 IU (8 arms). We could not calculate the total dose for 3 of the studies.25 27 35 Among those trial arms that used an infusion component the total infusion duration ranged from 5 minutes to 24 hours and the rate of oxytocin administration var- ied from 0.7 IU per hour to 120 IU per hour. Among the 5 trials that compareddifferent initial bolus doses within a bolus plus infusion regimen the initial bolus doses ranged from 0.5e10 IU. Dose-ﬁnding trials and nonrandomized studies We identiﬁed 4 dose-ﬁnding RCTs (180 women). The sample sizes ranged from 30e70 women. Two trials included women undergoing planned CD only and 1 trial included women undergoing intrapartum CD only. All studies used either an initial bolus or infusion fol- lowed by a maintenance infusion. We found 5 NRSIs that included 1840 women with sample sizes ranging from 41e1122 women. Of these 4 werecomparative studies (3 2-arm studies 1 3-arm study) and 1 was a dose-ﬁnding study. The most common type of IV administration was bolus only (4 arms).,"(208.2333221435547, 242.5922088623047, 538.9872436523438, 599.7499389648438)","(3, 4)",1480

A total of 15 RCTs (3921 women) compared different types of IV admin- istration regimens (Table 2Supplemental Table 5). The incidence of PPH 1000 mL was only reported for 1 comparison (bolus only vs bolus plus infusion). Bolus only vs infusion only. In 5 RCTs (338 women) bolus only regimens were compared with infusion only regimens. No study reported on the outcome of incidence of PPH 1000 mL. The effects of either dosing regimen on the use of additional uterotonics mean blood loss or maternal adverse effects (nausea vomiting chest pain and myocardial ischemia) are inconclusive because the certainty of evidence was very low. No other outcomes were reported. Bolus only vs bolus plus infusion. In 5 RCTs (4580 women) bolus only regi- mens were compared with bolus plus infusion regimens. The effect of either dosing regimen on the outcome of incidence of PPH 1000 mL was inconclusive because the certainty of evidence was very low (4 trials of 2976 women RR 1.44 95% CI 0.75e2.76 very low certainty) although bolus only regimens slightly increased the mean blood loss (5 trials of 3068 women MD 52 mL 95% CI 0.4e104 mL moderate certainty) (Figure 2) and decreased the incidence of satisfactory uterine tone (1 trial of 145 women RR 0.63 95% CI 0.41e0.95 low certainty) (Figure 3). There were no clear differences in themean change in hemoglobin (3 trials of 2260 women MD e0.05 g/dL 95% CI e0.27 to 0.17 g/dL high certainty) or incidence of blood transfusion (3 trials of 2870 women RR 1.55 95% CI 0.47e5.13 low certainty). The effects of either dosing regimen on the outcomes of incidence of PPH 500 mL use of additional uterotonics and maternal adverse effects (hypotension nausea and chest pain) were inconclusive because the certainty of evidence was very low. There were zero events re- ported for surgical or nonsurgical in- terventions vomiting bradycardia tachycardia and dyspnea. A sensitivity analysis on risk of bias (including only studies at an overall low risk of bias) suggested no clear difference in mean blood loss.

87,Intravenous oxytocin dosing regimens,In 5 RCTs (442 women) infusion only regimens were compared with bolus plus infusion regimens. No study re- ported on the outcome of incidence of PPH 1000 mL. There were no clear differences in the incidence of satisfac- tory uterine tone (2 trials of 164 women RR 0.98 95% CI 0.90e1.06 low certainty) blood transfusion (1 trial of 145 women RR 0.35 95% CI 0.04e3.26 low certainty) or maternal adverse events (vomiting [1 trial of 60 women RR 0.50 95% CI 0.06e4.18 low certainty] headache [1 trial of 152 women RR 0.36 95% CI 0.01e8.71 low certainty] hypotension [2 trials of 263 women RR 0.60 95% CI 0.34e1.05 moderate certainty] cardiac arrythmia [1 trial of 60 women RR1.50 95% CI 0.27e8.34 low cer- tainty] and tachycardia [1 trial of 143 women RR 0.96 95% CI 0.06e15.04 low certainty]). The effects on use of additional uterotonics mean blood loss and nausea were inconclusive because the certainty of evidence was very low. There were zero events re- ported for surgical interventions chest pain and dyspnea. Total oxytocin dose. A total of 17 RCTs (4663 women) compared different total oxytocin doses (Table 3 Supplemental Table 6). The outcome of the incidence of PPH 1000 mL was reported for 2 comparisons (<5 IU vs 5e9 IU and 5e9 IU vs 20e49 IU). Total oxytocin dose of <5 IU vs 5e9 IU. One RCT40 (145 women) compared a total oxytocin dose of <5 IU with 5e9 IU. It reported zero incidences of PPH 1000 mL with either dosing regimen. The effects on the use of additional uterotonics satisfactory uterine tone mean blood loss or maternal adverse events (nausea hypotension chest pain) were inconclusive because the certainty of evidence was very low. There were zero events reported for blood trans- fusions vomiting bradycardia tachy- cardia and dyspnea. Total oxytocin dose of 5e9 IU vs 10e19 IU. Three RCTs (177 women) compared a total oxytocin dose of 5e9 IU with 10e19 IU. No study reported on the incidence of PPH 1000 mL. The use of a total dose of 5e9 IU vs 10e19 IU may result in a large increase in the use of additional uterotonics (2 trials of 137 women RR 13.00 95% CI 1.75e96.37TABLE 4 Overview of study comparisons: initial bolus dose in a bolus plus infusion regimen Dose <5 IU 5 IU 10 IU <5 IU 1 RCT (90 women)  0.5 IU vs 1 IU vs 2 IU34 3 RCTs (180 women)  0.5 IU vs 1 IU vs 3 IU vs 5 IU22  2 IU vs 5 IU32  2 IU vs 5 IU42 No studies 5 IU — No studies 1 RCT (87 women)  5 IU vs 10 IU24 10 IU — — No studies Dose-ﬁnding studies (4 RCTs 1 NRSI) are not included in this table.

There was no clear difference in myocardial ischemia (1 trial of 103 women RR 0.98 95% CI 0.14e6.70 low certainty). The effect on mean blood loss was inconclusive because the certainty of evidence was very low. There were zero events re- ported for hypotension. Total oxytocin dose of 5e9 IU vs 20e49 IU. Four RCTs (2996 women) compared a total oxytocin dose of 5e9 IU with 20e49 IU. The effects of either dosing regimen on the out- comes of incidence of PPH 1000 mL PPH 500 mL use of additional uterotonics or blood transfusion or mean blood loss were inconclusive because the certainty of evidence was very low. There was no clear differ- ence in the change in hemoglobin (3 trials of 2260 women MD e0.05 g/dL 95% CI e0.27 to 0.17 g/dL low certainty). Total oxytocin dose of 10e19 IU vs 20e49 IU. Two RCTs (331 women) compared a total oxytocin dose of 10e19 IU with 20e49 IU. Neither study reported on the incidence of PPH 1000 mL. The use of a total dose of 10e19 IU compared with of 20e49 IUprobably reduces chest pain (1 trial of 271 women RR 0.05 95% CI 0.00e0.81 moderate certainty) (Supplemental Figure 5). There were no clear differences in the incidence of blood transfusion (1 trial of 271 women RR 0.86 95% CI 0.28e2.62 low cer- tainty) satisfactory uterine tone (1 trial of 271 women RR 1.05 95% CI 1.00e1.09 moderate certainty) or tachycardia (1 trial of 271 women RR 0.84 95% CI 0.26e2.69). The effects on the use of additional uterotonics mean blood loss nausea or vomiting were inconclusive because the certainty of evidence was very low. Total oxytocin dose of 20e49 IU vs 50 IU. One RCT36 (321 women) compared a total oxytocin dose of 20e49 IU with 50 IU. It did not report on the inci- dence of PPH 1000 mL.,"(208.2301025390625, 252.79502868652344, 367.6595153808594, 593.5132446289062)","(9, 10)",1475
88,Intravenous oxytocin dosing regimens,The use of doses of 20e49 IU compared with 50 IU may increase the use of additional uterotonics (RR 2.07 95% CI 1.42e3.01 low certainty) (Supplemental Figure 6). There were no clear differ- ences in mean blood loss (MD 20 mL 95% CI e14 to 54 mL low certainty) or hypotension (RR 1.05 95% CI 0.71e1.53 low certainty). Different bolus doses in bolus plus infusion regimens. A total of 5 RCTs using oxytocin regimens of bolus plus infusion (357 women) compared different initial bolus doses while keeping the infusion component identical for both trial arms (Table 4 Supplemental Table 7). Initial bolus dose of <5 IU vs 5 IU in a bolus plus infusion regimen. In 3 RCTs (180 women) in which a bolus plus infusion regimen was used an initial bolus dose of <5 IU was compared with that of 5 IU. No study reported on the incidence of PPH 1000 mL. Data from all 3 trials showed that initial bolus doses of <5 IU may reduce nausea (RR 0.29 95% CI 0.10e0.81 low certainty) (Supplemental Figure 7) but there were no clear differences in the use of addi- tional uterotonics (RR 1.08 95% CI 0.51e2.31 low certainty) or vomiting (RR 0.23 95% CI 0.05e1.04 low cer- tainty). The effect on mean blood loss was very uncertain owing to very low certainty about the evidence.

One RCT24(87 women) that employed a bolus plus infusion regimen compared an initial bolus dose of 5 IU with 10 IU. It did not report on the incidence of PPH 1000 mL and there were no clear differences in mean blood loss (MD 2 mL 95% CI e135 to 138 mL low certainty) cardiac arrythmia (RR 0.34 95% CI 0.01e8.14 low certainty) or chest pain (RR 0.41 95% CI 0.08e2.00 low certainty). There were zero events reported for surgical or nonsurgical interventions and dyspnea. We were largely unable to perform sensitivity and subgroup analyses owing to limited available data. However where data permitted these analyses no sig- niﬁcant effects were found except where otherwise described. Narrative synthesis. We reviewed dose-ﬁnding RCTs and NRSIs separately. Findings from these studies are inconclusive however we report the main ﬁndings below. The re- sults were not reported as statistically signiﬁcant unless otherwise noted. Dose-ﬁnding studies. A total of 4 dose- ﬁnding RCTs (180 women) studied the different initial doses required to initiate uterine contraction when followed by a maintenance infusion. No study re- ported on the incidence of PPH 1000 mL. The studies found that small doses (0.3 IU as a bolus or 0.27e0.29 IU/min as a short infusion) may be adequate to prevent uterine atony during plannedCD48e50 and that higher doses of oxytocin may be required during intra- partum CD regardless of the type of administration.47 50 One dose-ﬁnding NRSI55 (83 women) reported that small doses (1 IU as a bolus) may be adequate to prevent uterine atony with higher doses needed during intrapartum CD. Hypotension secondary to oxytocin administration was noted in all studies however was not explored in relation to speciﬁc doses or types of IV adminis- tration regimens. Nonrandomized studies. Type of intravenous administration. One study52 (1122 women critical risk of bias) compared bolus only with bolus plus infusion regimens. It suggested that more women who received bolus only regi- mens experienced PPH 1000 mL than women who received bolus plus infusion regimens greater use of additional ute- rotonics and increased incidence in blood transfusions. There were no sig- niﬁcant differences reported for any other outcomes.52 Another study53 (454 women moderate risk of bias) compared infusion only with bolus plus infusion regimens. It did not report on the inci- dence of PPH 1000 mL but suggested that women who received infusion only regimens experienced a greater overall decrease in hemoglobin levels. Total oxytocin dose. One study54 (73 women moderate risk of bias) compared a total oxytocin dose of 3 IU with that of 5 IU. It did not report on the incidence of PPH 1000 mL butsuggested more women who received 5 IU experienced vomiting when compared with women who received 3 IU. One study52 (1122 women critical risk of bias) compared a total oxytocin dose of 5 IU with that of 10 IU and 15 IU. It suggested that increased doses of oxytocin may result in less PPH 1000 mL the use of additional uterotonics and blood transfusions and may lead to more satisfactory uterine tone.52 One study51 (150 women critical risk of bias) compared a total oxytocin dose of 30 IU with that of 80 IU. It did not report on the incidence of PPH 1000 mL but suggested that 30 IU may lead to a sta- tistically signiﬁcant increase in the use of additional uterotonics and a decrease in satisfactory uterine tone. No signiﬁcant differences were reported for any other outcomes including hypotension.,"(208.2319793701172, 236.35496520996094, 538.98828125, 518.622314453125)","(10, 11)",1500
89,Intravenous oxytocin dosing regimens,Comment Main ﬁndings We identiﬁed 35 studies of 7333 women comparing different IV oxytocin regi- mens for PPH prevention following CD. The evidence in general was limited and data were lacking for most of the review outcomes with the data from 11 studies at high or critical risk of bias. We did not ﬁnd any clear differences in the incidence of PPH 1000 mL although data were sparse for this outcome. Bolus plus infusion regimens are possibly superior to bolus only regimens in terms of a small reduction in mean blood loss (around 52 mL) and increased uterineFIGURE 4 Total oxytocin dose of 5e9 IU vs 10e19 IU: use of additional uterotonics CI conﬁdence interval. Phung. Oxytocin dosing regimens for postpartum hemorrhage prevention following cesarean delivery. Am J Obstet Gynecol 2021. Systematic Reviews ajog.org 260 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology SEPTEMBER 2021 tone although these ﬁndings were based on a few trials. In general we found no clear indication of a superior total oxytocin dose (largely because of insuf- ﬁcient evidence). Although we found doses of 10e19 IU is possibly better than doses of 5e9 IU in terms of decreasing the use of additional uterotonics there were limited data on adverse maternal events (particularly hypotension). Of interest both studies used in the meta- analysis of this outcome exclusively compared 5 IU with 10 IU in a bolus only regimen. Oxytocin regimens were described using varying time intervals which complicated meaningful comparison. However available evidence suggests that when administering oxytocin in a bolus plus infusion regimen initial bolus doses of <5 IU may lead to less nausea but the effects of lower vs higher initial bolus doses on blood loss are not known. The infusion component of bolus plus infusion regimens most commonly continued for 2e4 hours. Findings from nonrandomized studies although not conclusive owing to a greater susceptibility to bias were broadly consistent with the ﬁndings of meta-analyses on RCTs. These generally indicated that bolus plus infusion regi- mens may be superior to bolus only regimens and that higher oxytocin doses may be more effective but can increase adverse maternal events. Among the bolus plus infusion regimens 4 dose- ﬁnding RCTs reported that small initial doses (0.3 IU as a bolus or 0.27e0.29 IU/ min as a short infusion) may be adequate to prevent uterine atony during planned CD 48e50 with higher doses required at intrapartum CD 47 50 but the evidence was not conclusive and should be inter- preted with caution. Comparison with existing literature Our ﬁndings are broadly consistent with previous work on IV oxytocin dosing regimens for PPH prevention following at CD including a 2012 systematic re- view7 of 7 RCTs (626 women) and a 2011 literature review.6 Both reviews recom- mended the use of a small initial bolus dose (ranging between 0.3 and 3 IU)6 7 with 1 review further recommending a bolus plus infusion regimen.7 Both re- views further reported more adverse hemodynamic events with higher doses of oxytocin which is consistent with our ﬁndings. Our ﬁndings are compatible with a 2019 international consensus statement 8 which recommends using a 1 IU bolus followed by a 2.5e7.5 IU/h infusion over 2e4 hours and the WHO recommendation of 10 IU oxytocin administered IVor intramuscular during all births with doses divided into a small initial IV bolus with subsequent infusion during CD.4 However it is evident that good-quality trials comparing different oxytocin dosing regimens are needed to guide practice. It is noteworthy to mention that national guidelines vary (Supplemental Table 8) probably reﬂecting the lack of clear evidence to guide practice. The 2017 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo- gists guidelines recommend using a dilute IV infusion (bolus dose of 10 IU) for PPH prevention without speciﬁca- tion for mode of delivery.57 Australian guidelines only recommend prophylac- tic oxytocin for all births without speci- fying a dosing regimen.61 Carbetocin is recommended in Canada during plan- ned CD 60 and a bolus only oxytocin regimen is recommended in the United Kingdom.58 French guidelines recom- mend a oxytocin bolus plus infusion regimen during CD however suggest an initial bolus dose of 5e10 IU.59Strengths and limitations We used a systematic and methodologi- cally robust approach to searching and analyzing literature without date or language restrictions. We included both randomized and nonrandomized studies which allowed for a more thor- ough and nuanced investigation of oxytocin dosing regimens. We also pre- speciﬁed outcomes that aligned with WHO priority outcomes4 and the PPH core outcome set11 and used the latest and more sophisticated iterations of the Cochrane risk of bias tools (ROB 2.0 and ROBINS-I).14 15Despite this evidence was generally limited for most outcomes. In a network meta-analysis by Gallos et al5 in which different uterotonic options werecompared the authors similarly described inadequate reporting of adverse events in trials of uterotonics for PPH prevention.5 The international consensus statement by Heesen et al8 also called for further large studies on this topic.8 Any such trials should be sufﬁciently powered for important health-related outcomes and should clearly specify the dosing regimen. Spe- ciﬁcally trials comparing different oxytocin doses of bolus plus infusion regimens should be conducted. We consider it particularly important that future trials should report on the outcome of PPH 1000 mL an impor- tant outcome for clinical guideline de- cision making. We also found hypotension to be a poorly studied outcome despite dose- dependent hypotension being well described.21 29 42 46 62 Among RCTs the effects of different dosing regimens on hypotension were generally either inconclusive or equivocal. No NRSI re- ported signiﬁcant differences in the incidence of hypotension. However it would not seem unreasonable to expect an increased incidence of hypotension with higher doses (particularly with bolus regimens) and it is likely that the combination of a bolus plus infusion regimen allows doses to exceed 5 IU while avoiding signiﬁcant hemodynamic instability. Indeed we consider it particularly important to prioritize research in this area.,"(379.5586853027344, 269.0130920410156, 539.0031127929688, 731.2767944335938)","(11, 12)",1471
90,Intravenous oxytocin dosing regimens,We also did not ﬁnd any clear evidence of diminishing returns from increasing doses and/or longer time periods of infusion despite it also being well described.22 26 Again this was largely because of lack of good-quality data and is an area for which further research is required. We identiﬁed a wide range of dosing regimens that added to the complexity of this analysis and likely contributed to high heterogeneity. Although we aimed to standardize comparisons by using total oxytocin dose we were not able to account for other factors such as rate of oxytocin administration or total infu- sion time. We acknowledge that our dose categories are somewhat arbitrary although necessary to standardize andajog.org Systematic Reviews SEPTEMBER 2021 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology 261 interpret comparisons. We also tried to minimize the effect of subjective judg- ments on blood loss by including this in our risk of bias assessment and per- forming sensitivity analyses. Finally the majority of studies included only women undergoing plan- ned CD with low risk of PPH. Hence these ﬁndings may not be generalizable to other higher-risk groups of women who may require a different oxytocin regimen. Conclusions and implications Based on current evidence the most appropriate oxytocin regimen may be bolus plus infusion and an initial bolus of <5 IU although further trials are needed to conﬁrm these conclusions. Bolus only regimens of 10 IU vs 5 IUmay decrease the use of additional utero- tonics however further research is required to understand the implications on adverse events particularly hypoten- sion. In the absence of more robust evi- dence many current guidelines on PPH prevention following CD may warrant reconsideration. Further research is required particularly in women at high risk for PPH for other important out- comes such as adverse maternal events breastfeeding and maternal well-being and satisfaction. Final conclusion This systematic review and meta- analysis of IV oxytocin dosing regimens for PPH prevention during CDs identi- ﬁed a lack of data for several important outcomes. Future well-designed studies are required to identify an optimal oxytocin dosing regimen for women undergoing CD. Nevertheless available data suggest that an IV bolus plus infu- sion regimen with an initial bolus dose of <5 IU may be preferable. However the degree of certainty for the evidence was generally low and further research is required to identify the optimal oxytocin regimen for PPH prevention during CDs. -ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to acknowledge Patrick Condron (The University of Melbourne Melbourne Australia) for his assistance with the search strategy Dr Rangi de Silva MBBS (Mercy Hos- pital for Women Heidelberg Australia) for her insights on this topic Dr Matthew Page PhD (Monash University Clayton Australia) and Dr Tari Turner PhD (Monash University) for their insights on data analysis and Liz Comrie- Thomson (Burnet Institute Melbourne Australia) for her insights on the entire research process.

DOI: 10.1111/1471-0528.14178 Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage This is the second edition of this guideline which was published in 2009 under the same title. The 2009 guideline was based on an earlier guideline on the management of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) developed in 1998 under the auspices of the Scottish Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and updated in 2002.1Executive summary of recommendations Prediction and prevention of PPH What are the risk factors for developing PPH and how can they be minimised? Risk factors Risk factors for PPH may present antenatally or intrapartum care plans must be modiﬁed as and when risk factors arise. ✓Clinicians must be aware of risk factors for PPH and should take these into account when counselling women about place of delivery. ✓Women with known risk factors for PPH should only be delivered in a hospital with a blood bank on site. DMinimising risk – treating antenatal anaemia Antenatal anaemia should be investigated and treated appropriately as this may reduce the morbidity associated with PPH. [New 2016] DMinimising risk – reducing blood loss at delivery Uterine massage is of no beneﬁt in the prophylaxis of PPH. [New 2016] AProphylactic uterotonics should be routinely offered in the management of the third stage of labour in all women as they reduce the risk of PPH. ARCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e107 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsFor women without risk factors for PPH delivering vaginally oxytocin (10 iu by intramuscular injection) is the agent of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour. A higher dose of oxytocin is unlikely to be beneﬁcial. A For women delivering by caesarean section oxytocin (5 iu by slow intravenous injection) should be used to encourage contraction of the uterus and to decrease blood loss. BErgometrine–oxytocin may be used in the absence of hypertension in women at increased risk of haemorrhage as it reduces the risk of minor PPH (500–1000 ml). CFor women at increased risk of haemorrhage it is possible that a combination of preventative measures might be superior to syntocinon alone to prevent PPH. [New 2016] ✓Clinicians should consider the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (0.5–1.0 g) in addition to oxytocin at caesarean section to reduce blood loss in women at increased risk of PPH. [New 2016] AHow should PPH be managed? Identiﬁcation of the severity of haemorrhage Clinicians should be aware that the visual estimation of peripartum blood loss is inaccurate and that clinical signs and symptoms should be included in the assessment of PPH. [New 2016] CCommunication and multidisciplinary care Communication with the woman Communication with the patient and her birthing partner is important and clear information of what is happening should be given from the outset. [New 2016] ✓Who should be informed when the woman presents with PPH? Relevant staff with an appropriate level of expertise should be alerted of PPH. [New 2016] ✓The midwife in charge and the ﬁrst-line obstetric and anaesthetic staff should be alerted when women present with minor PPH (blood loss 500–1000 ml) without clinical shock. ✓A multidisciplinary team involving senior members of staff should be summoned to attend to women with major PPH (blood loss of more than 1000 ml) and ongoing bleeding or clinical shock. ✓RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e108 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsResuscitation Measures for minor PPH Measures for minor PPH (blood loss 500–1000 ml) without clinical shock: ✓  intravenous access (one 14-gauge cannula)  urgent venepuncture (20 ml) for: – group and screen – full blood count – coagulation screen including ﬁbrinogen  pulse respiratory rate and blood pressure recording every 15 minutes  commence warmed crystalloid infusion.

Hydroxyethyl starch should not be used.  the best equipment available should be used to achieve rapid warmed infusion of ﬂuids  special blood ﬁlters should not be used as they slow infusions. Blood transfusion There are no ﬁrm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion. The decision to provide blood transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment. [New 2016] ✓Selection of red cell units for transfusion Major obstetric haemorrhage protocols must include the provision of emergency blood with immediate issue of group O rhesus D (RhD)-negative and K-negative units with a switch to group-speciﬁc blood as soon as feasible.

106,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,[New 2016] ✓Intraoperative cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in PPH associated with caesarean section and with vaginal delivery. [New 2016] DBlood components Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) If no haemostatic results are available and bleeding is continuing then after 4 units of red blood cells FFP should be infused at a dose of 12–15 ml/kg until haemostatic test results are known. [New 2016]D If no haemostatic tests are available early FFP should be considered for conditions with a suspected coagulopathy such as placental abruption or amniotic ﬂuid embolism or where detection of PPH has been delayed. [New 2016]✓ If prothrombin time/activated partial thromboplastin time is more than 1.5 times normal and haemorrhage is ongoing volumes of FFP in excess of 15 ml/kg are likely to be needed to correct coagulopathy. [New 2016]D Clinicians should be aware that these blood components must be ordered as soon as a need for them is anticipated as there will always be a short delay in supply because of the need for thawing. [New 2016]✓ Fibrinogen A plasma ﬁbrinogen level of greater than 2 g/l should be maintained during ongoing PPH. [New 2016] CCryoprecipitate should be used for ﬁbrinogen replacement. [New 2016] DTransfusion of platelets During PPH platelets should be transfused when the platelet count is less than 75 3 109/l based on laboratory monitoring. [New 2016] DIs there a role for antiﬁbrinolytic drugs? Consideration should be given to the use of tranexamic acid in the management of PPH. [New 2016] BRCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e110 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsIs there a role for recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) therapy? The routine use of rFVIIa is not recommended in the management of major PPH unless as part of a clinical trial. [New 2016] ✓Monitoring and investigation in major PPH: what investigations should be performed and how should women be monitored? Full protocol for monitoring and investigation in major PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml) and ongoing haemorrhage or clinical shock:  immediate venepuncture (20 ml) for: – cross-match (4 units minimum) – full blood count – coagulation screen including ﬁbrinogen – renal and liver function for baseline  monitor temperature every 15 minutes  continuous pulse blood pressure recording and respiratory rate (using oximeter electrocardiogram and automated blood pressure recording)  Foley catheter to monitor urine output  two peripheral cannulae 14 gauge  consider arterial line monitoring (once appropriately experienced staff available for insertion)  consider transfer to intensive therapy unit once the bleeding is controlled or monitoring at high dependency unit on delivery suite if appropriate  recording of parameters on a modiﬁed early obstetric warning score (MEOWS) chart (see Appendix IV)  acting and escalating promptly when abnormal scores from a MEOWS chart are observed  documentation of ﬂuid balance blood blood products and procedures. What is the role of the anaesthetist in the management of PPH? The management of PPH requires a multidisciplinary approach: the anaesthetist plays a crucial role in maintaining haemodynamic stability and if necessary in determining and administering the most appropriate method of anaesthesia. [New 2016]D What methods should be employed to arrest the bleeding? Clinicians should be prepared to use a combination of pharmacological mechanical and surgical methods to arrest PPH. These methods should be directed towards the causative factor. [New 2016] DWhat pharmacological and mechanical strategies can be used? When uterine atony is perceived to be a cause of the bleeding then a sequence of mechanical and pharmacological measures should be instituted in turn until the bleeding stops. ✓D RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e111 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsWhat surgical treatments can be employed to arrest the bleeding? If pharmacological measures fail to control the haemorrhage surgical interventions should be initiated sooner rather than later. DIntrauterine balloon tamponade is an appropriate ﬁrst-line ‘surgical’ intervention for most women where uterine atony is the only or main cause of haemorrhage. CConservative surgical interventions may be attempted as second line depending on clinical circumstances and available expertise. CIt is recommended that a laminated diagram of the brace suture technique be kept in theatre. ✓Resort to hysterectomy sooner rather than later (especially in cases of placenta accreta or uterine rupture). CIdeally and when feasible a second experienced clinician should be involved in the decision for hysterectomy. ✓How should secondary PPH be managed? In women presenting with secondary PPH an assessment of vaginal microbiology should be performed (high vaginal and endocervical swabs) and appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy should be initiated when endometritis is suspected. [New 2016]D A pelvic ultrasound may help to exclude the presence of retained products of conception although the diagnosis of retained products is unreliable. [New 2016] CSurgical evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by an experienced clinician. DRisk management Training and preparation: what measures can be taken to ensure optimal management of PPH? Every maternity unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol for the management of PPH. [New 2016] ✓All staff involved in maternity care should receive training in the management of obstetric emergencies including the management of PPH. BTraining for PPH should be multiprofessional and include team rehearsals. [New 2016] BAll cases of PPH involving a blood loss of greater than 1500 ml should be the subject of a formal clinical incident review.

Purpose and scopePrimary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the most common form of major obstetric haemorrhage.,"(45.35430145263672, 125.91072845458984, 549.8875732421875, 354.0167541503906)","(5, 8)",1472
107,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,The traditional deﬁnition of primary PPH is the loss of 500 ml or more of blood from the genital tract within 24 hours of the birth of a baby.2 PPH can be minor (500–1000 ml) or major (more than 1000 ml). Major can be further subdivided into moderate (1001–2000 ml) and severe (more than 2000 ml). In women with lower body mass (e.g. less than 60 kg) a lower level of blood loss may be clinically signiﬁcant.3 The recommendations in this guideline apply to women experiencing a primary PPH of 500 ml or more. Secondary PPH is deﬁned as abnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally.4 This guideline also includes recommendations speciﬁc to the management of secondary PPH. Women with pre-existing bleeding disorders and women taking therapeutic anticoagulants are at increased risk of PPH this guideline does not include speciﬁc recommendations for the management of such situations or for managing haemorrhage in women who refuse blood transfusion. Guidance on these topics is available from other sources.5–8This guideline has been developed primarily for clinicians working in consultant-led obstetric units in the UK recommendations may be less appropriate for other settings where facilities resources and routine practices differ. There is increasing emphasis on the availability of births at home or in midwife-led units.9 Obstetricians and midwives should develop guidelines for the management of obstetric emergencies that may occur in the community including PPH. This is beyond the scope of this guideline.10This guideline is restricted in scope to the management of PPH the management of antepartum haemorrhage is the subject of the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 63.11 The prevention and management of PPH related to placenta praevia and placenta praevia accreta is addressed in Green-top Guideline No. 27 12 while Green-top Guideline No. 4713provides guidance on the appropriate use of blood and blood products in obstetric practice. 2. Introduction and background epidemiologyObstetric haemorrhage remains one of the major causes of maternal death in both developed and developing countries. The 2011–13 Conﬁdential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths and Morbidity report3 identiﬁed 13 direct deaths due to obstetric haemorrhage in the UK and Ireland the report places obstetric haemorrhage as the second leading cause of direct maternal deaths. The recommendations from the report focus on basic clinical skills with prompt recognition of the severity of a haemorrhage and emphasise communication and teamwork in the management of these cases. A systematic review14 suggests that there may be regional variation in the prevalence of PPH. Standardisation of the measurement of PPH is recommended so that data from different regions are comparable.15RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e113 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists3. Identiﬁcation and assessment of evidenceThis guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-top Guidelines. The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE]) EMBASE Trip MEDLINE and PubMed (electronic databases) were searched for relevant randomised controlled trials systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search was restricted to articles published between 2007 and September 2015. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms including all subheadings and this was combined with a keyword search. Search words included ‘postpartum h(a)emorrhage’ ‘factor VII’ ‘Syntocinon’ ‘carbetocin’ ‘carboprost’ ‘oxytocics’ ‘uterotonics’ ‘B-lynch suture’ ‘uterine artery embolism’ ‘bilateral internal iliac ligation’ ‘balloon Rusch’ ‘Sengstaken catheters’ ‘thromboelastography’ ‘thromboelastometry’ ‘ﬁbrinogen concentrate’ ‘point of care testing’ and the search limited to humans and the English language. The National Library for Health and the National Guideline Clearinghouse were also searched for relevant guidelines and reviews. Guidelines and recommendations produced by organisations such as the British Committee for Standards in Haematology Transfusion Taskforce and national bodies were considered. Where possible recommendations are based on available evidence and the areas where evidence is lacking are annotated as ‘good practice points’. Further information about the assessment of evidence and the grading of recommendations may be found in Appendix I. 4. Prediction and prevention of PPH4.1 What are the risk factors for developing PPH and how can they be minimised? 4.1.1 Risk factors Risk factors for PPH may present antenatally or intrapartum care plans must be modiﬁed as and when risk factors arise. ✓Clinicians must be aware of risk factors for PPH and should take these into account when counselling women about place of delivery. ✓Women with known risk factors for PPH should only be delivered in a hospital with a blood bank on site. DA number of case–control studies have identiﬁed antenatal and intrapartum risk factors for PPH (see Appendix II) 16–26 although most cases of PPH have no identiﬁable risk factors.27 These risk factors have been summarised in a 2010 review.28 Despite methodological limitations these studies provide a guide to levels of risk which can help clinicians in their discussions with women about setting for delivery (Table 1). The Conﬁdential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health29 has recommended that women with known risk factors for PPH should not be delivered in a hospital without a blood bank on site. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada has published a guideline on the prevention and management of PPH.30 This summarises the causes of PPH as related to abnormalities of one or more of four basic processes – ‘the four Ts’: tone trauma tissue and thrombin.

108,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,Haemoglobin (Hb) levels outside the normal UK range for pregnancy (110 g/l at ﬁrst contact and 105 g/l at 28 weeks) should be investigated and iron supplementation considered if indicated. It is recommended that parenteral iron therapy should be considered antenatally for women with iron deﬁciency anaemia who do not respond to oral iron.10Evidence level 4 A population-based study34 has indicated an association between antenatal anaemia (Hb less than 90 g/l) and greater blood loss at delivery and postpartum.

AProphylactic uterotonics should be routinely offered in the management of the third stage of labour in all women as they reduce the risk of PPH. AFor women without risk factors for PPH delivering vaginally oxytocin (10 iu by intramuscular injection) is the agent of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour. A higher dose of oxytocin is unlikely to be beneﬁcial. A For women delivering by caesarean section oxytocin (5 iu by slow intravenous injection) should be used to encourage contraction of the uterus and to decrease blood loss. BErgometrine–oxytocin may be used in the absence of hypertension in women at increased risk of haemorrhage as it reduces the risk of minor PPH (500–1000 ml). CFor women at increased risk of haemorrhage it is possible that a combination of preventative measures might be superior to syntocinon alone to prevent PPH. ✓Clinicians should consider the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (0.5–1.0 g) in addition to oxytocin at caesarean section to reduce blood loss in women at increased risk of PPH. AUterine massage A Cochrane review35 analysed the effectiveness of uterine massage after birth and before or after delivery of the placenta or both to prevent PPH. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included and the review found no signiﬁcant difference between groups. Evidence level 1+ Management of the third stage of labour Various Cochrane reviews have addressed prophylaxis in the third stage of labour for women delivering vaginally.35–38 These have established that both active management and the use of prophylactic uterotonics in the third stage of labour reduce the risk of PPH. Active management of the third stage of labour involves the use of interventions (including the use of uterotonics early clamping of the umbilical cord and controlled cord traction) to expedite delivery of the placenta with the aim of reducing blood loss. In expectant management signs of placental separation are awaited and the placenta is delivered spontaneously. A Cochrane systematic review39 found that for women at mixed levels of risk of bleeding active management showed a reduction in the average risk of maternal primary haemorrhage at time of birth (more than 1000 ml average risk ratio [RR] 0.34 95% CI 0.14–0.87) and maternal Hb less than 90 g/l following birth (average RR 0.50 95% CI 0.30–0.83). Evidence level 1++ RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e116 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsHowever active management results in a lower birthweight reﬂecting a lower blood volume from early cord clamping.39 A systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials40 found that delaying clamping for at least 2 minutes is beneﬁcial to the newborn and that the beneﬁts extend into infancy. Therefore active management of the third stage that includes routine early clamping of the umbilical cord can no longer be recommended. A detailed consideration of the literature relating to the timing of cord clamping can be found in RCOG Scientiﬁc Impact Paper No. 14.41 Guidance from NICE9 recommends that the umbilical cord should not be clamped earlier than 1 minute from delivery of the baby if there are no concerns over cord integrity or the baby’s wellbeing. Evidence level 1+ Oxytocin and ergometrine–oxytocin McDonald and colleagues’ meta-analysis36 addressed prophylactic ergometrine–oxytocin versus oxytocin for the third stage of labour. This review indicated that ergometrine–oxytocin (Syntometrine Alliance Chippenham Wiltshire UK) oxytocin 5 iu and oxytocin 10 iu have similar efﬁcacy in preventing PPH in excess of 1000 ml.,"(65.76380157470703, 643.7894287109375, 508.02496337890625, 388.6001281738281)","(10, 12)",1477
109,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,Using the deﬁnition of PPH as blood loss of at least 500 ml ergometrine–oxytocin was associated with a small reduction in the risk of PPH (Syntometrine versus oxytocin any dose OR 0.82 95% CI 0.71–0.95). There were major differences between ergometrine–oxytocin and oxytocin alone in the adverse effects of nausea and vomiting and elevation of blood pressure with ergometrine–oxytocin carrying a ﬁve-fold increased risk (OR 4.92 95% CI 4.03–6.00). Thus the advantage of a reduction in the risk of minor PPH needs to be weighed against the adverse effects associated with the use of ergometrine–oxytocin. Evidence level 1++ An RCT 42 using a primary outcome of any treatment of uterine atony or haemorrhage assessed whether or not a higher dose of oxytocin after vaginal delivery was more effective than a low-dose regimen in preventing PPH after a vaginal delivery. Compared with 10 iu administering 40 iu or 80 iu of prophylactic oxytocin did not reduce overall PPH treatment when given in 500 ml over 1 hour for vaginal delivery. Evidence level 1+ Prostaglandins The use of prostaglandins for the prevention of PPH has been the subject of two Cochrane reviews.37 38 Neither intramuscular prostaglandins (such as carboprost a 15-methyl prostaglandin F2a analogue) nor misoprostol (a prostaglandin E1 analogue given orally or sublingually) were preferable to conventional injectable uterotonics (oxytocin and/or ergometrine) for routine prophylaxis.37 Furthermore another systematic review43 concluded that oxytocin is superior to misoprostol in the prevention of PPH. Evidence level 1++ Appraisal of the evidence from both the Cochrane reviews together with consideration of standard practice in the UK suggests that for women delivering vaginally oxytocin 10 iu by intramuscular injection is the regimen of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour. Intramuscular oxytocin should be administered with the birth of the anterior shoulder or immediately after the birth of the baby and before the cord is clamped and cut. This strategy has been endorsed in the NICE intrapartum care guideline.9Evidence level 1+ Carbetocin A Cochrane review44 has addressed the use of a longer-acting oxytocin derivative carbetocin in the prevention of PPH. Carbetocin is licensed in the UK speciﬁcally for the indication of prevention of PPH in the context of caesarean delivery. Use of carbetocin resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in the need for further uterotonics compared with oxytocin for those undergoing a caesarean but not for vaginal delivery. However there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between carbetocin and oxytocin in terms of risk of PPH. Evidence level 1++ RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e117 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsGuidelines from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada30 recommend that carbetocin (100 micrograms given as an intravenous bolus over 1 minute) should be used for the prevention of PPH in elective caesarean deliveries. Randomised trials45–50 have compared different uterotonics (oxytocin ergometrine–oxytocin misoprostol carbetocin and 15-methyl prostaglandin F2a) for prophylaxis in women delivering by caesarean section. Appraisal of the evidence from these trials together with consideration of standard practice in the UK led the development group for the NICE caesarean section guideline51 to recommend oxytocin 5 iu by slow intravenous injection for prophylaxis in the context of caesarean delivery. Evidence level 1+ Tranexamic acid The use of tranexamic acid in the prevention of PPH in women considered to be at low risk of PPH was addressed in a Cochrane review.52 This found that blood loss greater than 400 or 500 ml was less common in women who received tranexamic acid in addition to the usual uterotonic agent after vaginal birth or caesarean section in a dosage of 1 or 0.5 g intravenously. Tranexamic acid was effective in decreasing the incidence of blood loss greater than 1000 ml in women who had undergone caesarean section (RR 0.43 95% CI 0.23–0.78 four studies 1534 women) but not vaginal birth. Mean blood loss until 2 hours postpartum was lower in the group of women who received intravenous tranexamic acid postpartum (mean difference 77.79 ml 95% CI 97.95 to 57.64 ﬁve studies 1186 women). The authors of the Cochrane review on the use of tranexamic acid in the prevention of PPH conclude that further studies are required to investigate the risk of serious adverse effects including thromboembolic events and the use of tranexamic acid in women considered to be at high risk of PPH (see section 5.3.6). Evidence level 1++ 5. How should PPH be managed? 5.1 Identiﬁcation of the severity of haemorrhage Clinicians should be aware that the visual estimation of peripartum blood loss is inaccurate and that clinical signs and symptoms should be included in the assessment of PPH. CAs visual estimation often underestimates blood loss 53 54 more accurate methods may be used such as blood collection drapes for vaginal deliveries55 and the weighing of swabs.56 However a study57 comparing visual estimation of blood loss with the use of a collector bag after vaginal delivery concluded that the latter did not signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of severe PPH. Participating in clinical reconstructions may encourage early diagnosis and prompt treatment of PPH.58 Written and pictorial guidelines may help staff working in labour wards to estimate blood loss.59Evidence level 2+ Clinical signs and symptoms of hypovolaemia should be included in the assessment of PPH. However clinicians should be aware that the physiological increase in circulating blood volume during pregnancy means that the signs of hypovolaemic shock become less sensitive in pregnancy.60 In pregnancy pulse and blood pressure are usually maintained in the normal range until blood loss exceeds 1000 ml tachycardia tachypnoea and a slight recordable fall in systolic blood pressure occur with blood loss of 1000–1500 ml.,"(65.76380157470703, 252.38937377929688, 487.53070068359375, 717.4188842773438)","(12, 13)",1485
110,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,A systolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg associated with worsening tachycardia tachypnoea and altered mental state usually indicates a PPH in excess of 1500 ml.61Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e118 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsIn nonpregnant patients the shock index calculated from the heart rate/systolic blood pressure has been employed as an early marker of haemodynamic compromise.61 A retrospective cohort study62 concluded that the shock index identiﬁes women at risk of adverse outcomes secondary to PPH (e.g. admission to an intensive care unit) and compares favourably with conventional vital signs. Evidence level 2 The 2009–12 Conﬁdential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths and Morbidity report3 highlighted the importance of correlating clinical signs and symptoms expected from different blood loss values to help target decisions on resuscitation and also emphasised the importance of taking the woman’s weight into account. It is of note that the severity of haemorrhage was not recognised in 11 of the 17 (61%) women who died. Evidence level 4 5.2 Communication and multidisciplinary care 5.2.1 Communication with the woman Communication with the patient and her birthing partner is important and clear information of what is happening should be given from the outset. ✓PPH often occurs unexpectedly and can be very stressful for the woman and her partner or birth attendants it is crucial that where feasible they are kept informed and reassured if appropriate of the clinical development and proposed management. 5.2.2 Who should be informed when the woman presents with PPH? Relevant staff with an appropriate level of expertise should be alerted of PPH. ✓The midwife in charge and the ﬁrst-line obstetric and anaesthetic staff should be alerted when women present with minor PPH (blood loss 500–1000 ml) without clinical shock. ✓A multidisciplinary team involving senior members of staff should be summoned to attend to women with major PPH (blood loss of more than 1000 ml) and ongoing bleeding or clinical shock. ✓Early involvement of appropriate senior staff (including the anaesthetic team and laboratory specialists) is fundamental to the management of PPH. In minor PPH the ﬁrst-line staff should be alerted and in major PPH the following members of staff should be called and summoned to attend: an experienced midwife (in addition to the midwife in charge)  the obstetric middle grade  the anaesthetic middle grade  the on-call clinical haematologist with experience in major haemorrhage  porters for delivery of specimens/blood. Furthermore the consultant obstetrician and consultant anaesthetist should be alerted and the blood transfusion laboratory should be informed. One member of the team should be assigned the task of recording events ﬂuids drugs blood and components transfused and vital signs. RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e119 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsClinicians and blood transfusion staff should liaise at a local level to agree:  a standard form of words (such as ‘we need compatible blood now’ or ‘group-speciﬁc blood’) to be used in cases of major obstetric haemorrhage  a timescale in which to deliver various blood components. The use of the term ‘controlled major obstetric haemorrhage’ or ‘ongoing major obstetric haemorrhage’ may be used to deﬁne the urgency to the team. Senior obstetric staff must be receptive to concerns expressed by less experienced or junior medical practitioners and by midwives. The RCOG recommends that the consultant obstetrician should attend in person when there is a PPH of more than 1500 ml where the haemorrhage is continuing.63Evidence level 4 5.3 Resuscitation 5.3.1 Measures for minor PPH Measures for minor PPH (blood loss 500–1000 ml) without clinical shock: ✓  intravenous access (one 14-gauge cannula)  urgent venepuncture (20 ml) for: – group and screen – full blood count – coagulation screen including ﬁbrinogen  pulse respiratory rate and blood pressure recording every 15 minutes  commence warmed crystalloid infusion. 5.3.2 Measures for major PPH Full protocol for major PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml) and continuing to bleed or clinical shock (see Appendix III): ✓  A and B – assess airway and breathing  C – evaluate circulation  position the patient ﬂat  keep the woman warm using appropriate available measures  transfuse blood as soon as possible if clinically required  until blood is available infuse up to 3.5 l of warmed clear ﬂuids initially 2 l of warmed isotonic crystalloid. Further ﬂuid resuscitation can continue with additional isotonic crystalloid or colloid (succinylated gelatin). Hydroxyethyl starch should not be used.  the best equipment available should be used to achieve rapid warmed infusion of ﬂuids  special blood ﬁlters should not be used as they slow infusions. RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e120 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsA high concentration of oxygen (10–15 l/min) via a facemask should be administered regardless of maternal oxygen concentration. If the airway is compromised owing to impaired conscious level anaesthetic assistance should be sought urgently. Usually level of consciousness and airway control improve rapidly once the circulating volume is restored. Establish two 14-gauge intravenous lines a 20 ml blood sample should be taken and sent for diagnostic tests including full blood count coagulation screen urea and electrolytes and to cross-match packed red cells (4 units). The urgency and measures undertaken to resuscitate and arrest haemorrhage need to be tailored to the degree of shock (Table 2). The cornerstones of resuscitation during PPH are restoration of both blood volume and oxygen-carrying capacity. Volume replacement must be undertaken on the basis that blood loss is often underestimated.59 64 Compatible blood (supplied in the form of red cell concentrate) to replace red cell loss should be transfused as soon as available if necessary. The clinical picture should be the main determinant of the need for blood transfusion and time should not be unnecessarily spent awaiting laboratory results.65 66 Obstetricians should draw on the expertise of their colleagues in anaesthesia haematology and transfusion medicine in determining the most appropriate combination of intravenous clear ﬂuids blood and blood products for continuing resuscitation.,"(45.35430145263672, 623.77685546875, 507.957275390625, 663.5033569335938)","(13, 16)",1473
111,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,Guidance from the British Committee for Standards in Haematology67 summarises the main therapeutic goals of the management of massive blood loss as maintaining:Evidence level 4  Hb greater than 80 g/l  platelet count greater than 50 9 109/l  prothrombin time (PT) less than 1.5 times normal  activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) less than 1.5 times normal  ﬁbrinogen greater than 2 g/l. Table 2. Fluid therapy and blood product transfusion (see sections 5.3.3 5.3.4 and 5.3.5)Crystalloid Up to 2 l isotonic crystalloid. Colloid Up to 1.5 l colloid until blood arrives. Blood If immediate transfusion is indicated give emergency group O rhesus D (RhD)-negative K-negative red cell units. Switch to group-speciﬁc red cells as soon as feasible. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) Administration of FFP should be guided by haemostatic testing and whether haemorrhage is continuing:  If prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are prolonged and haemorrhage is ongoing administer 12–15 ml/kg of FFP.  If haemorrhage continues after 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs) and haemostatic tests are unavailable administer 4 units of FFP. Platelet concentrates Administer 1 pool of platelets if haemorrhage is ongoing and platelet count less than 75 9 109/l. Cryoprecipitate Administer 2 pools of cryoprecipitate if haemorrhage is ongoing and ﬁbrinogen less than 2 g/l. RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e121 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists5.3.3 Fluid replacement Fluid replacement is a crucial component of PPH treatment although a dilutional coagulopathy may occur when large volumes of crystalloid colloid or red cells are used with insufﬁcient transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets. Traditionally a total volume of 3.5 l of clear ﬂuids (up to 2 l of warmed isotonic crystalloid as rapidly as possible followed by up to a further 1.5 l of warmed colloid if blood is still not available) comprises the maximum that should be infused while awaiting compatible packed red cells.1 While there is controversy as to the most appropriate ﬂuids for volume resuscitation 68–70 the nature of ﬂuid infused is of less importance than rapid administration and warming of the infusion.71 The woman needs to be kept warm using appropriate measures to prevent hypothermia which in turn could exacerbate acidosis.72Evidence level 4 There have been no RCTs comparing the use of colloids with other replacement ﬂuids for the resuscitation of women with PPH. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO)73recommend that intravenous ﬂuid replacement for PPH should be with isotonic crystalloids in preference to colloids. A Cochrane review74 compared colloids with crystalloids for ﬂuid resuscitation in critically ill nonpregnant patients (patients with burns trauma or following surgery). This review concluded that resuscitation with colloids was not associated with an improvement in survival and that the use of one particular colloid hydroxyethyl starch might increase mortality. Evidence level 1++ 5.3.4 Blood transfusion There are no ﬁrm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion. The decision to provide blood transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment. ✓The use of blood and blood products in obstetric practice is addressed in the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47.13 There are no ﬁrm criteria for initiating red cell transfusion75 76 and the decision to provide blood transfusion should be based on both clinical and haematological assessment. While blood transfusion is almost always required when the Hb is less than 60 g/l and rarely required when the Hb is more than 100 g/l patients with acute haemorrhage can have normal Hb and clinical evaluation in this situation is therefore extremely important. Between 2009 and 2012 3 there were at least three maternal deaths where an acute point of care Hb measurement result is thought to have falsely reassured staff. Furthermore the Serious Hazards of Transfusion reporting scheme has highlighted the risk of errors in using near patient testing of Hb measurements to guide transfusion.77 While single Hb/ haematocrit estimations may be misleading and can lead to delays in initiating red cell transfusion serial measurements may be helpful to monitor ongoing progress. Guidelines from the European Society of Anaesthesiology78 recommend that repeated measurements of serum lactate and base deﬁcit together with haematocrit/Hb are made during haemorrhage and resuscitation to assess tissue perfusion and oxygenation however it has not yet been shown whether the outcome of severe bleeding can be improved if volume resuscitation is guided by serum lactate concentration and base deﬁcit. Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e122 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsSelection of red cell units for transfusion. Major obstetric haemorrhage protocols must include the provision of emergency blood with immediate issue of group O rhesus D (RhD)-negative and K-negative units with a switch to group-speciﬁc blood as soon as feasible. D If clinically signiﬁcant red cell antibodies are present close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is essential to avoid delay in transfusion in life-threatening haemorrhage. DAll delivery units especially small units without a blood bank on site should maintain a supply of group O RhD-negative blood. ✓Intraoperative cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in PPH associated with caesarean section and with vaginal delivery. DPregnant women (and women of childbearing age) who are RhD negative must only receive RhD-negative blood to avoid the risk of D alloimmunisation.79 Previous blood transfusion is an important cause of alloimmunisation with antibodies other than anti-D in particular anti-K causing severe haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.80 Accordingly unless a woman is known to be K positive only K-negative blood should be used for transfusion in women of childbearing age.79 The aim of antibody screening is to determine the presence of red cell antibodies of likely clinical signiﬁcance.,"(65.7637939453125, 528.02392578125, 507.9404602050781, 457.9922180175781)","(16, 18)",1458
112,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,In addition to the risk of haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn 80 these red cell antibodies may have implications for the selection of blood for transfusion in the mother owing to the risk of haemolytic transfusion reactions and the laboratory should select red cell units negative for the relevant antigen for cross-matching. Close liaison with the transfusion laboratory is essential with input if needed from the clinical haematology team and specialist advice from the national blood service. Evidence level 4 All delivery units especially small units without a blood bank on site should maintain a supply of group O RhD- negative blood as this might offer the only means of restoring oxygen-carrying capacity within an acceptable timescale. The minimum number of units of group O RhD-negative K-negative blood to be maintained on site should be agreed within local protocols and should reﬂect the likely period of delay in the arrival of further supplies should an emergency arise small delivery units remote from the nearest blood bank will require a larger minimum supply than those a short distance from a blood bank. Cross-matching versus electronic issue of blood The principles of blood grouping antibody testing and selection of blood in pregnancy are addressed in the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 47.13The majority of laboratories in the UK now use automated testing for blood grouping and antibody testing with advanced information technology systems for documentation and reporting of results. The hospital transfusion laboratory can readily provide red cells that are ABO and RhD compatible using electronic issue with no cross-matching needed provided that the patient does not have any antibodies and there are robust automated systems in place for antibody testing and identiﬁcation of the patient.79 In this setting since blood can be readily issued there is no need to reserve units for individual cases. Where electronic issue is not available a locally agreed maximum surgical blood ordering schedule should be used to decide how many red cell units should be reserved and available for particular cases based on the obstetric diagnosis. In unforeseen haemorrhage group O RhD-negative and K-negative units must be immediately available for emergency use with a switch to group-speciﬁc blood as soon as feasible. Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e123 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsCytomegalovirus (CMV) status In elective transfusion in the antenatal period CMV-seronegative products should be used to avoid transmission of CMV to the fetus although the UK policy of universal leucocyte depletion substantially reduces the risk of CMV transmission.81 82 In an emergency such as PPH standard leucocyte-depleted components should be given to avoid delay and CMV-negative blood or platelets are not needed for transfusion during delivery or in the postpartum period.82 Evidence level 4 Intraoperative cell salvage Intraoperative cell salvage (the process whereby blood shed during an operation is collected ﬁltered and washed to produce autologous red blood cells [RBCs] for transfusion to the patient) is commonly being used in cardiac orthopaedic and vascular surgery with a relative reduction of blood transfusion of 38% and an absolute risk reduction of 21%. Cell salvage does not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes.83 84 Several bodies have endorsed cell salvage in obstetric practice including NICE 85the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE)10 and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.86 It has been proposed that cell salvage should be considered for emergency use in PPH associated with both caesarean section and vaginal delivery.87 Although large prospective trials of cell salvage with autotransfusion in obstetrics are lacking to date no single serious complication leading to poor maternal outcome has been directly attributed to its use. A large RCT is currently in progress comparing intraoperative cell salvage with donor blood transfusions (standard care) during caesarean section in women at risk of haemorrhage (SALVO study UKCRN ID14032).88Evidence level 4 5.3.5 Blood components There are limited data to inform best clinical practice for the management of haemostatic impairment during PPH but the principle of management is to prevent and treat haemostatic abnormalities during bleeding but not to correct abnormalities in nonbleeding women. It is not known whether haemostasis should be corrected to normality for pregnant or nonpregnant women. Methods to assess haemostatic impairment during PPH include clinical observation laboratory-based tests (PT APTT Clauss ﬁbrinogen and platelet count) and point of care testing.89 Studies in patients following surgery show that laboratory or point of care testing leads to appropriate use of blood components90 and both may be used simultaneously. Coagulopathies may evolve rapidly and repeated testing (such as every 30 minutes) during continued bleeding and observation of trends are more useful than single measurements. Evidence level 3 Routine coagulation tests are widely available and have well-regulated quality control.89 91 They include PT APTT Clauss ﬁbrinogen assay and platelet count. However turnaround times are often too slow to be clinically useful in acute and rapidly evolving bleeds and inevitably reﬂect the past haemostatic status of the woman. Clauss ﬁbrinogen should always be measured as part of the routine coagulation screen because it falls early and may be reduced to a clinically signiﬁcant level despite a normal PT/APTT.89 91 92 Platelet number should be measured as part of the full blood count. RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e124 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsPoint of care testing using viscoelastometry such as thromboelastography (TEG Haemonetics Braintree Massachusetts USA) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM Tem Munich Germany) combined with an agreed treatment algorithm has been associated with decreased blood loss and blood product use both outside and within the obstetric setting.89 93 94 The main advantage is that results are known sooner than for laboratory tests. Point of care testing using TEG and ROTEM has been recommended by the Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association/Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.95 However NICE has concluded that there is insufﬁcient evidence to recommend the routine adoption of viscoelastometric point of care testing in the management of PPH.96 If used a quality control protocol should be agreed with the haematology laboratory.

113,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,DIf no haemostatic tests are available early FFP should be considered for conditions with a suspected coagulopathy such as placental abruption or amniotic ﬂuid embolism or where detection of PPH has been delayed. ✓ If PT/APTT is more than 1.5 times normal and haemorrhage is ongoing volumes of FFP in excess of 15 ml/kg are likely to be needed to correct coagulopathy. DClinicians should be aware that these blood components must be ordered as soon as a need for them is anticipated as there will always be a short delay in supply because of the need for thawing. ✓ Formulaic protocols such as 1:1 or 6:4 RBC:FFP based on data derived from traumatic bleeding have been advocated for the management of major haemorrhage.69 71 However there is no evidence that this improves outcomes in PPH. The drawbacks of early FFP are that the majority of women with PPH will have normal coagulation at the time of administration 97–99 and that it is associated with an increased risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)100 and transfusion-related acute lung injury.101 FFP results in relatively small increments in ﬁbrinogen level and to increase the level rapidly cryoprecipitate or ﬁbrinogen concentrate are required.102There are limited data on the utility of laboratory and point of care coagulation tests to guide FFP replacement during PPH. Abnormal PT/APTT suggests progression towards signiﬁcant haemostatic impairment while PT/APTT greater than 1.5 times normal demonstrate that severe and established haemostatic impairment has occurred.67 68 103If the PPH has stopped no FFP is required. If haemorrhage is ongoing and the last PT/APTT results are available and are prolonged 12–15 ml/kg of FFP should be requested and infused with the aim of maintaining the PT/APTT at less than 1.5 times normal.68 If the PT/APTT is greater than 1.5 times normal a larger volume of FFP is likely to be required to correct these parameters 104 and this may be associated with an increased risk of TACO. If the PT/APTT are normal then no FFP is required although repeated testing should be performed if bleeding persists. Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e125 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsIf the results of haemostatic tests are not available and haemorrhage is continuing then after 4 units of RBCs have been transfused FFP should be infused at a dose of 12–15 ml/kg and 6:4 RBC:FFP transfusion maintained until tests of haemostasis are available. Such empirical use of FFP is in line with published guidance.67 68 71 105 FFP transfusion earlier than this could be considered for placental abruption or amniotic ﬂuid embolism because these situations are associated with early coagulopathy106 107 or if diagnosis of PPH has been delayed. Evidence level 4 In rare cases of massive bleeding where women have been given 8 or more units of RBCs and they continue to bleed and still no coagulation results or platelet counts are available then 2 pools of cryoprecipitate and 1 pool of platelets should be infused.108 Evidence level 3 Fibrinogen A plasma ﬁbrinogen level of greater than 2 g/l should be maintained during ongoing PPH. CCryoprecipitate should be used for ﬁbrinogen replacement. DObservational studies show that a ﬁbrinogen level of 1.0–1.5 g/l is likely to be too low for adequate haemostasis during ongoing PPH.97 98 109–111 Fibrinogen below 3 g/l and especially below 2 g/l is associated with progression of bleeding increased RBC and blood component requirements and the need for invasive procedures.109 Evidence level 2+ A double-blind RCT112 has shown that pre-emptive infusion of 2 g ﬁbrinogen concentrate in women with 500–1000 ml PPH has no beneﬁt however the ﬁbrinogen level at the time of randomisation was greater than 4 g/l in most women. Evidence level 1 The appropriate ﬁbrinogen intervention trigger or target level is unknown. A pragmatic view based on available evidence is that during continuing PPH cryoprecipitate or ﬁbrinogen concentrate should be used to maintain a ﬁbrinogen level of at least 2 g/l even if PT/APTT are normal. Fibrinogen loss can be replaced by cryoprecipitate or ﬁbrinogen concentrate although ﬁbrinogen concentrate is not licensed for acquired hypoﬁbrinogenaemia in the UK. Similar clinical outcomes and increments in ﬁbrinogen have been reported for cryoprecipitate and ﬁbrinogen concentrate but these are based on limited data.113 It is expected that 2 pools of cryoprecipitate (1 pool is taken from ﬁve donors) would increase the ﬁbrinogen level by about 1 g/l. Increasing the ﬁbrinogen level by 1 g/l requires about 60 mg/kg ﬁbrinogen concentrate.114 Observational studies report improved clinical haemostasis and possible reduced use of FFP and post-transfusion-related events such as TACO 94 115associated with infusion of ﬁbrinogen but RCTs are required.93 113 114 116 117 Evidence level 3 Transfusion of platelets During PPH platelets should be transfused when the platelet count is less than 75 3 109/l based on laboratory monitoring. DThere is general consensus that platelets should be transfused at a trigger of 75 9 109/l to maintain a level greater than 50 9 109/l during ongoing PPH.68 71 Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e126 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists5.3.6 Is there a role for antiﬁbrinolytic drugs? Consideration should be given to the use of tranexamic acid in the management of PPH. BA large RCT118 found that early administration of tranexamic acid in the management of trauma in nonpregnant patients resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in death from haemorrhage. The dose employed in this study was 1 g intravenously over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 hours. One RCT119assessed the role of high-dose tranexamic acid in PPH.,"(65.76380157470703, 267.2596435546875, 507.9319763183594, 293.1859130859375)","(20, 22)",1487
114,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,Women with PPH greater than 800 ml following vaginal delivery were randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (loading dose 4 g over 1 hour then infusion of 1 g/hour over 6 hours) or not the study concluded that high-dose tranexamic acid can reduce blood loss fall in Hb and the need for blood transfusion. The study was not powered to address safety issues and speciﬁcally the risk of the treatment causing deep vein thrombosis. A Cochrane review2 on treatments for PPH found that trials testing the effectiveness of tranexamic acid were too small to draw meaningful conclusions. A large trial120 is currently in progress aiming to determine the effect of early administration of tranexamic acid on mortality hysterectomy and other morbidities in women with PPH. The dose of tranexamic acid employed in this trial is 1 g by intravenous injection a second dose may be given after 30 minutes. Evidence level 1+ 5.3.7 Is there a role for recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) therapy? The routine use of rFVIIa is not recommended in the management of major PPH unless as part of a clinical trial. ✓rFVIIa (NovoSeven Novo Nordisk Bagsværd Denmark) is an expensive product that is licensed in the UK for the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with speciﬁc inherited bleeding disorders. Outwith its licence it has been used primarily in the management of uncontrolled haemorrhage in the trauma setting. It reduces blood loss through enhancement of tissue factor-dependent coagulation. Its effectiveness is markedly diminished by hypothermia acidosis and low platelets so effective resuscitation towards normal physiology is a prerequisite of its use.121Evidence level 3 There are only poor quality data from anecdotal reports or patient registries to support its use.122 Systematic reviews of case series and observational studies have examined the use of rFVIIa in PPH.123 124 In a review of the literature regarding the use of rFVIIa in the treatment of PPH Ahonen122 concluded that rFVIIa should not be used to compensate for inadequate blood transfusion therapy administration of blood and blood products as well as management of uterine atony are essential in the treatment of PPH before considering administration of rFVIIa. A 2015 open-label RCT125 (n = 84) found that administration of rFVIIa lowered the risk of requiring second-line therapies by 44% (RR 0.56 95% CI 0.42–0.76) compared with controls (no rFVIIa) in women with PPH in whom uterotonics had failed to arrest the bleeding. All 84 women survived but two women in the intervention group experienced a venous thromboembolism (2/42). A study126 investigating the safety of rFVIIa when employed on an off-label basis to treat life-threatening haemorrhage found a signiﬁcant increase in the risk of arterial but not venous thromboembolic events when compared with placebo (5.5% versus 3.2%). Evidence level 1+ RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e127 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsThe use of rFVIIa may be considered as a treatment for life-threatening PPH but should not delay or be considered a substitute for a life-saving procedure such as embolisation or surgery or transfer to a referral centre. 5.4 Monitoring and investigation in major PPH: what investigations should be performed and how should women be monitored? Full protocol for monitoring and investigation in major PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml) and ongoing haemorrhage or clinical shock: D  immediate venepuncture (20 ml) for: – cross-match (4 units minimum) – full blood count – coagulation screen including ﬁbrinogen – renal and liver function for baseline  monitor temperature every 15 minutes  continuous pulse blood pressure recording and respiratory rate (using oximeter electrocardiogram and automated blood pressure recording)  Foley catheter to monitor urine output  two peripheral cannulae 14 gauge  consider arterial line monitoring (once appropriately experienced staff available for insertion)  consider transfer to intensive therapy unit once the bleeding is controlled or monitoring at high dependency unit on delivery suite if appropriate  recording of parameters on a modiﬁed early obstetric warning score (MEOWS) chart (see Appendix IV)  acting and escalating promptly when abnormal scores from a MEOWS chart are observed  documentation of ﬂuid balance blood blood products and procedures. Continuous physiological monitoring is necessary and the recording of parameters over time on a ﬂow chart that will give the reader good visual cues on the clinical progress of the patient (Appendix IV). The need to continually re-evaluate the woman’s physiological condition even when bleeding appears to have stopped is essential to recognise continuing bleeding. The presence of a central line not only provides a means of accurate central venous pressure monitoring but also a route for rapid ﬂuid replacement. Nevertheless the threshold for instituting invasive monitoring has been controversial with some authorities advising early recourse to central venous pressure monitoring127–129 and others advocating caution.76 130 The 2000–02 report of the UK Conﬁdential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths (CEMD)29 included the recommendation: ‘Central venous and direct arterial pressure monitoring should be used when the cardiovascular system is compromised by haemorrhage or disease’. Central venous pressure monitoring requires early involvement of a senior skilled anaesthetist who will usually take responsibility for this aspect of management. The use of ultrasound is more likely to make the procedure safer 29 as this procedure carries signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality.131 Once bleeding is under control transfer to an intensive care or high dependency unit on delivery suite should be considered depending on the severity of the blood loss (see section 5.6.3). Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e128 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsIt is also important that once the bleeding is arrested and any coagulopathy is corrected chemical thromboprophylaxis is administered as there is a high risk of thrombosis. Alternatively anti-embolism stockings foot impulse devices or intermittent pneumatic compression devices can be used if chemical thromboprophylaxis is contraindicated for example in cases of thrombocytopenia.132Evidence level 4 5.5 What is the role of the anaesthetist in the management of PPH? The management of PPH requires a multidisciplinary approach: the anaesthetist plays a crucial role in maintaining haemodynamic stability and if necessary in determining and administering the most appropriate method of anaesthesia.,"(65.76380157470703, 227.4366912841797, 513.0629272460938, 258.7548522949219)","(22, 24)",1492
115,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,D Anaesthetists play an important role in the multidisciplinary team involved in the management of patients with PPH. A senior anaesthetist should be consulted early to help assess initiate and continue prompt resuscitation of these patients using their expertise in ﬂuid and transfusion therapy as well as their experience in managing critically ill patients.10If the patient needs to go to theatre for a surgical intervention an experienced anaesthetist should promptly assess the patient in order to decide on the most suitable mode of anaesthesia depending on the patient’s haemodynamic status. Central neuraxial anaesthesia has become the anaesthetic technique of choice in the obstetric population and this has resulted in a reduction in maternal mortality.133While general anaesthesia in obstetric patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality when compared with regional anaesthesia due to the physiological changes that occur in pregnancy 9 it may be preferable in patients who are haemodynamically unstable or who have a coagulopathy. The patient may need high dependency or intensive care in the postoperative period. An obstetric early warning score system would help in the early identiﬁcation of continuous bleeding especially in cases which are not apparent as recommended by CMACE (see Appendix IV).131Evidence level 4 5.6 What methods should be employed to arrest the bleeding? Clinicians should be prepared to use a combination of pharmacological mechanical and surgical methods to arrest PPH. These methods should be directed towards the causative factor. DCareful clinical examination is required to determine the cause of PPH (see Table 1 and Appendix II for the risk factors and causes of PPH). A 2014 Cochrane review2 addressing the treatment of primary PPH found no trials evaluating surgical techniques or radiological interventions for women with primary PPH that were unresponsive to pharmacological methods. Thus recommendations on treatment strategies are based on observational data and consensus only. Evidence level 4 5.6.1 What pharmacological and mechanical strategies can be used? When uterine atony is perceived to be a cause of the bleeding then a sequence of mechanical and pharmacological measures should be instituted in turn until the bleeding stops. ✓RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e129 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsThe most common cause of primary PPH is uterine atony.27 The initial management of PPH should therefore involve measures to stimulate myometrial contractions. The following mechanical and pharmacological measures should be instituted/administered in turn:2 palpate the uterine fundus and rub it to stimulate contractions (‘rubbing up the fundus’)  ensure that the bladder is empty (Foley catheter leave in place)  oxytocin 5 iu by slow intravenous injection (may have repeat dose)  ergometrine 0.5 mg by slow intravenous or intramuscular injection (contraindicated in women with hypertension)  oxytocin infusion (40 iu in 500 ml isotonic crystalloids at 125 ml/hour) unless ﬂuid restriction is necessary  carboprost 0.25 mg by intramuscular injection repeated at intervals of not less than 15 minutes to a maximum of eight doses (use with caution in women with asthma)  misoprostol 800 micrograms sublingually. The simple mechanical and physiological measures of ‘rubbing up the fundus’ and emptying the bladder to stimulate uterine contraction represent ﬁrst-line management of PPH. No published studies have been identiﬁed to provide an evidence base for these interventions nevertheless professional consensus supports their continued use.134Despite decades of empirical use in clinical practice there are no trials comparing ergometrine with oxytocin as ﬁrst-line agents for the treatment of PPH. It seems appropriate to use both agents although oxytocin is to be preferred initially especially in women with hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Previous guidance1 advocated an initial dose of 10 iu oxytocin by slow intravenous injection for treatment (rather than prophylaxis) of PPH. The British National Formulary recommends a dose of 5 iu ‘by slow intravenous injection (dose may be repeated)’.135 The 1997–99 report of the UK CEMD highlighted the risk of profound hypotension that may be associated with oxytocin injection.136 This guideline has adopted the CEMD recommendation that ‘When given as an intravenous bolus the drug should be given slowly in a dose of not more than 5 iu’. This dosage is in line with guidance from other authorities.30 135Evidence level 4 There are no trials comparing the prostaglandin carboprost (15-methyl prostaglandin F2a) with other uterotonic agents. Two case series from the USA 137 138 comprising 26 and 237 cases respectively have reported on the use of carboprost in the successful management of PPH without resort to surgical interventions in 85% and 95% of cases. Two of the four failures in the smaller series were associated with placenta accreta. If bleeding occurs at the time of caesarean section intramyometrial injection of carboprost may be used (although not licensed). It is also possible to inject intramyometrial carboprost through the abdominal wall in the absence of laparotomy. The recommended dose is 250 micrograms intramuscularly. This may be repeated every 15 minutes to a total dose of 2 mg (eight doses). However if signiﬁcant atonic haemorrhage continues after a third dose of carboprost without signiﬁcant improvement (i.e. 30 minutes or more after the ﬁrst dose was given) the team should consider transfer to the operating theatre for examination under anaesthesia with an awareness of the impending need for laparotomy and/or hysterectomy. Evidence level 3 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e130 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsTwo systematic reviews 2 139 which includes the 2014 Cochrane review focused on misoprostol to treat PPH and examined the optimal route and dosage and its efﬁcacy. Compared with 40 iu oxytocin infusion 800 micrograms sublingual misoprostol was associated with a signiﬁcant increase in the number of women who had blood loss of at least 1000 ml (RR 2.65 95% CI 1.04–6.75) and who required blood transfusion (RR 1.47 95% CI 1.02–2.14). The review authors concluded that oxytocin infusion should be recommended as ﬁrst-line treatment for primary PPH. When used following prophylactic uterotonics misoprostol and oxytocin infusion work similarly.,"(65.76380157470703, 219.45370483398438, 507.9677734375, 221.2430419921875)","(24, 26)",1488
116,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,Evidence level 1+ A study140 of women in early pregnancy demonstrated that regardless of the route of administration (vaginal sublingual or rectal) misoprostol took 1.0–2.5 hours to increase uterine tone. Clinicians should be aware of this delay in the clinical effect of misoprostol. Guidelines from WHO141 and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics142 recommend that in the management of PPH misoprostol is administered sublingually. Evidence level 4 5.6.2 What surgical treatments can be employed to arrest the bleeding? If pharmacological measures fail to control the haemorrhage surgical interventions should be initiated sooner rather than later. DIntrauterine balloon tamponade is an appropriate ﬁrst-line ‘surgical’ intervention for most women where uterine atony is the only or main cause of haemorrhage. CConservative surgical interventions may be attempted as second line depending on clinical circumstances and available expertise. CIt is recommended that a laminated diagram of the brace suture technique be kept in theatre. ✓Resort to hysterectomy sooner rather than later (especially in cases of placenta accreta or uterine rupture). CIdeally and when feasible a second experienced clinician should be involved in the decision for hysterectomy. ✓The use of pharmacological agents other than those detailed should not delay recourse to surgery. Once the decision is made to embark on surgical haemostasis the most appropriate choice of procedure will depend in part on the experience and expertise of available staff. Compression of the aorta may be a temporary but effective measure to allow time for resuscitation to catch up with the volume replacement and the appropriate surgical support to arrive. The judgement of senior clinicians taking into account the individual woman’s future reproductive aspirations is required in deciding the appropriate sequence of interventions. The management of placenta praevia accreta is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and guidance is available in the RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 27.12RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e131 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists5.6.2.1 Uterine balloon tamponade Tamponade using various types of hydrostatic balloon catheter has superseded uterine packing for the control of atonic PPH.143 Case series have used a Foley catheter 144 Bakri balloon 145 Sengstaken– Blakemore oesophageal catheter146 147 and a condom catheter.148 The urological Rusch balloon has been described as preferable by virtue of larger capacity ease of use and low cost.149 A detailed protocol for uterine tamponade using the Rusch balloon is available.149 The 2014 Scottish Conﬁdential Audit of Severe Maternal Morbidity report identiﬁed 339 women who had an estimated blood loss of 2500 ml or higher in 82 cases balloon tamponade was employed successfully avoiding hysterectomy in 75 (91%) women.150 This success rate is of the same order as that reported in other case series. Evidence level 3 Some of the reports of balloon tamponade148 151 describe the intervention as the ‘tamponade test’. A ‘positive test’ (control of PPH following inﬂation of the balloon) indicates that laparotomy is not required whereas a ‘negative test’ (continued PPH following inﬂation of the balloon) is an indication to proceed to laparotomy. The concept of balloon tamponade as a ‘test’ serves to afﬁrm its place as ﬁrst-line ‘surgical’ management. There is no clear evidence on how long the balloon tamponade should be left in place. In most cases 4–6 hours of tamponade should be adequate to achieve haemostasis and ideally it should be removed during daytime hours in the presence of appropriate senior staff in case further intervention is necessary.146 147Evidence level 4 A systematic review concluded that uterine balloon tamponade is an effective treatment for PPH in resource-poor settings.152 Evidence level 2++ 5.6.2.2 Haemostatic suturing Several case series153 have been published describing success with haemostatic brace sutures. The best known version described by B-Lynch in 1997 154 requires hysterotomy for its insertion and is particularly suitable when the uterus has already been opened for a caesarean section. A review published in 2005155summarised nine case series of B-Lynch suturing (a total of 32 cases) reporting success in all but one case. In 2002 Hayman et al.156 described a modiﬁed compression suture which does not require hysterotomy and success in 10/11 women managed with this suture has been reported.157 Other authors have described variants on these techniques.158 159 Double vertical compression sutures have proved effective in treating PPH due to atony and placenta praevia. This may have a dual action of reducing uterine blood ﬂow and compressing the bleeding surface.160A prospective population-based study of 211 women treated with a uterine compression suture to control PPH concluded that the overall failure rate of sutures leading to hysterectomy was 25%.161 There was no difference in failure rate among B-Lynch modiﬁed B-Lynch and other suture techniques. Risk factors for a hysterectomy included increasing age and vaginal delivery. In addition a prolonged delay of 2–6 hours between delivery and uterine compression suture was independently associated with a four-fold increased risk of hysterectomy. This emphasises the need for careful postpartum evaluation of blood loss to avoid prolonged delay in haemorrhage recognition. Evidence level 3 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e132 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsThe 2014 Scottish Conﬁdential Audit of Severe Maternal Morbidity report150 identiﬁed 21 cases where haemostatic brace suturing was used for the management of PPH (greater than or equal to 2500 ml) hysterectomy was averted in 16 (76%) women. Again this success rate is of the same order as that reported in other case series. Evidence level 3 These observational data suggest that haemostatic suture techniques are effective in controlling severe PPH and in reducing the need for hysterectomy. In the absence of comparative data to demonstrate that any one variant is superior to another obstetricians are encouraged to familiarise themselves with one technique under the supervision of an experienced colleague. It is recommended that a laminated diagram of the brace suture technique be kept in theatre. A systematic review162 has concluded that compression sutures are associated with a low complication rate.,"(65.76380157470703, 123.12181091308594, 507.90087890625, 314.84222412109375)","(26, 28)",1486
117,Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage,A higher risk of uterine ischaemia appeared to be caused when the procedure was combined with vessel ligation. No negative impact on fertility has been reported. Case series have reported the combined use of haemostatic suturing and balloon tamponade in the management of PPH.163–165 Evidence level 3 5.6.2.3 Stepwise uterine devascularisation and internal iliac artery ligation Stepwise uterine devascularisation describes the successive ligation of (i) one uterine artery (ii) both uterine arteries (iii) low uterine arteries (iv) one ovarian artery and (v) both ovarian arteries in the management of PPH.166 The original case series167 of 103 patients with intractable PPH not responding to medical management was effective in all cases without the need for hysterectomy leading some clinicians to propose that stepwise uterine devascularisation should be the ﬁrst-line conservative surgical treatment to control PPH. When internal iliac artery ligation is being considered a senior gynaecologist or vascular surgeon should be informed and involved since this technique requires a high degree of surgical skill and training and may be associated with ureteric injury. A case series described 84 women with PPH from various causes who underwent internal iliac artery ligation as the ﬁrst-line surgical intervention. Hysterectomy was subsequently required in 33 (39%) women.168A study of 45 women following internal iliac artery ligation suggests that subsequent fertility and pregnancy outcomes are not impaired.169 Evidence level 3 A systematic review170 of fertility outcomes following the surgical management of PPH concluded that uterine devascularisation techniques including internal iliac artery ligation did not adversely affect future fertility although the number of studies and quality of evidence was limited. Evidence level 2++ RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e133 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists5.6.2.4 Selective arterial occlusion or embolisation by interventional radiology A large retrospective study171 has evaluated arterial embolisation in 251 patients after PPH. It was successful in arresting the bleeding in 86.5% (217/251). The analysis suggested that caesarean section delivery disseminated intravascular coagulation and transfusion of more than 10 units of packed red cells were related to failed embolisation. Evidence level 3 The logistics of performing arterial occlusion or embolisation where the equipment or an interventional radiologist may not be available mean that uterine balloon tamponade is a more appropriate ﬁrst-line treatment. Follow-up studies of 17172 and 25173 women who underwent arterial embolisation for treatment of PPH suggest that the intervention does not impair subsequent menstruation fertility and obstetric outcomes. Selective arterial occlusion may also be effective after failed internal iliac artery ligation.174Evidence level 3 5.6.2.5 Hysterectomy The decision for hysterectomy should be made by an experienced consultant clinician and the decision preferably discussed with a second experienced clinician when feasible.29 Early recourse to hysterectomy is recommended especially where bleeding is associated with placenta accreta or uterine rupture.12 Hysterectomy should not be delayed until the woman is in extremis or while less deﬁnitive procedures with which the surgeon has little experience are attempted. The procedure should be carried out by a surgeon who is experienced in carrying out hysterectomies. Subtotal hysterectomy is the operation of choice in many instances of PPH requiring hysterectomy unless there is trauma to the cervix or a morbidly adherent placenta in the lower segment. Evidence level 4 Sequential reports of the Scottish Conﬁdential Audit of Severe Maternal Morbidity from 2003 until 2012 summarised in the ﬁnal 2014 publication 150 have shown a statistically signiﬁcant fall in the proportion of women with PPH (with blood loss greater than or equal to 2500 ml) requiring a hysterectomy to control the bleeding and an increase in the use of conservative surgical techniques. Evidence level 3 5.6.3 Intensive and high dependency units and post-PPH care The 2006–08 CMACE report10 identiﬁed that three deaths were due to lack of optimal care following PPH and in particular a lack of routine observation in the postpartum period. Sequential reports10 131 have recommended the use of MEOWS charts to alert caregivers to abnormal trends in haemodynamic measurements. Evidence level 4 A prospective audit175 of the management of major PPH (deﬁned in the audit as blood loss of 2500 ml or more transfused 5 or more units of packed red cells or received treatment for coagulopathy) found that the majority of women received high dependency care on the labour ward while only 21% were admitted to intensive care. The authors concluded that care for these women may be better provided by obstetricians and anaesthetists on the labour ward a view that others have shared.176Evidence level 3 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e134 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists6. How should secondary PPH be managed? In women presenting with secondary PPH an assessment of vaginal microbiology should be performed (high vaginal and endocervical swabs) and appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy should be initiated when endometritis is suspected. D A pelvic ultrasound may help to exclude the presence of retained products of conception (RPOC) although the diagnosis of retained products is unreliable. CSurgical evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by an experienced clinician. DThe causes of secondary PPH are numerous and include endometritis RPOC and subinvolution of the placental implantation site.177 178 The management of women presenting with secondary PPH should include an assessment of their haemodynamic status an assessment of the blood loss and an evaluation of the woman’s concerns (for example is her bleeding becoming inconvenient because it has persisted longer than she had expected?). Evidence level 4 Investigations should include bacteriological testing for endometritis (high vaginal swab) although a low yield of positive vaginal swab results has been reported in patients with secondary PPH.179 In contrast Pather et al.180 found a high incidence of abnormal vaginal microbiology (52%) and endometritis in their case series supporting the practice of routine assessment of vaginal microbiology and appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy in women presenting with secondary PPH. Evidence level 3 A Cochrane review investigated the effect of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of postpartum endometritis.181 This review concluded that a combination of clindamycin and gentamicin is appropriate and that once uncomplicated endometritis has clinically improved with intravenous therapy there is no additional beneﬁt from further oral therapy.,"(65.763671875, 272.564208984375, 507.95513916015625, 527.5541381835938)","(28, 30)",1486

Case series180 183–186 have reported a wide range of sensitivities and speciﬁcities of ultrasound in the detection of RPOC (44–94% and 16–92% respectively). These series suggest that the presence of an echogenic mass and a thickened ‘endometrium’ is associated with RPOC. In a prospective observational study187 of 79 women with secondary PPH Mulic-Lutvica and Axelsson concluded that an echogenic mass in the uterine cavity and an anteroposterior diameter of the cavity above the 90th centile (approximately 25 mm on days 1–7 postpartum) was associated with RPOC. Since the range of sensitivities and speciﬁcities of ultrasound in the detection of RPOC is so wide the clinical ﬁndings including the degree of bleeding and whether the cervical os is open should be taken into account before the decision to undertake surgery is made. It has been proposed that colour ﬂow Doppler imaging should be included in the evaluation of the postpartum uterus although there is no strong evidence to support its use 178 its use may facilitate the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous malformations which are rare but recognised causes of secondary PPH.188–190Evidence level 3 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e135 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsSurgical evacuation of the uterus for RPOC is not without morbidity and can result in uterine perforation (1.5%)180 191 and Asherman’s syndrome.192 It is therefore recommended that surgical evacuation of retained placental tissue should be undertaken or supervised by an experienced clinician. An appropriately trained clinician may consider performing uterine evacuation under direct ultrasound guidance. A 2002 Cochrane review (assessed as up-to-date in January 2008) addressed treatments for secondary PPH.4 No trials were identiﬁed which met the review group’s inclusion criteria and no recommendations were made regarding effective treatments. Uterotonics such as misoprostol and ergometrine have been recommended in the management of secondary PPH although evidence to support their use is limited.178 Transcatheter arterial embolisation193 and balloon tamponade194 have been employed in cases of secondary PPH with ongoing bleeding. Evidence level 3 7. Risk management7.1 Training and preparation: what measures can be taken to ensure optimal management of PPH? Every maternity unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol for the management of PPH. ✓All staff involved in maternity care should receive training in the management of obstetric emergencies including the management of PPH. BTraining for PPH should be multiprofessional and include team rehearsals. BAll cases of PPH involving a blood loss of greater than 1500 ml should be the subject of a formal clinical incident review. DTo ensure optimal management of PPH every unit should have a multidisciplinary protocol with which staff should be familiar (see section 5). Updates on the management of obstetric emergencies (including the management of PPH) are a proactive approach to risk management. Skills drills should ensure that all members of staff including those working in the transfusion laboratory are aware of their role in the management of PPH. A systematic review195 of the effectiveness of multidisciplinary simulation training in obstetric emergencies (including PPH) showed that teamwork training in a simulation setting resulted in improvement of knowledge practical skills communication and team performance. Training in a simulation centre did not further improve outcome compared with training at a local unit. Evidence level 2++ The RCOG recommends that all cases of PPH with an estimated blood loss of more than 1500 ml should be the subject of a formal clinical incident review.196 Evidence level 4 RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 52 e136 of e149 ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists7.2 Documentation Accurate documentation of a delivery with PPH is essential. ✓Accurate documentation is important for further clinical management continuity of care and team work. In addition inadequate documentation can contribute to the likelihood of there being medicolegal consequences.197 The team member recording events on the structured proforma the scribe is crucial in the management of PPH (see Appendix V) the proforma is effectively a checklist of available interventions and team leaders should communicate with the scribe during the PPH to ensure that no steps have been omitted. PPH should be notiﬁed through a clinical incident reporting or risk management system. Evidence level 4 It is important to record:  the staff in attendance and the time they arrived  the sequence of events  the administration of different pharmacological agents their timing and sequence  the time of surgical intervention where relevant  the condition of the mother throughout the different steps  the timing of the ﬂuid and blood products given. 7.3 Debrieﬁng An opportunity to discuss the events surrounding the obstetric haemorrhage should be offered to the woman (possibly with her birthing partner/s) at a mutually convenient time. ✓After obstetric emergencies women can be psychologically affected by postnatal depression or fear of further childbirth. Major PPH can be traumatic to women and their families and has been associated with the subsequent development of post-traumatic stress disorder.198 Women who have experienced a major PPH should be offered an opportunity to discuss the events surrounding their delivery. A discussion of future pregnancy including the likelihood of a repeat PPH and any fears regarding pregnancy and childbirth that the woman may have should be addressed. This should include arrangements for appropriate investigations as necessary such as testing for coagulopathies if there are other indicators and screening for the rare complication of postpartum hypopituitarism (Sheehan syndrome) secondary to hypotension.199Evidence level 4 8. Recommendations for future research RCTs are required to identify the best drug combinations route and dose of uterotonics for the treatment of primary PPH.  The role of viscoelastometric point of care tests using TEG and ROTEM in the management of PPH requires evaluation.  Studies are required to determine the optimal ratio of packed red cells to FFP in the management of obstetric haemorrhage.

Methods—‘PubMed’ ‘EMBASE’ ‘CENTRAL’ and ‘CINAHL’ electronic databases were searched for clinical trials analyzing the effectiveness of different dose of oxytocin given intravenously during surgery for uterine contraction and to reduce postpartum hemorrhage. A systematic review of relevant literature sources was performed. Results—our search revealed 813 literature sources. A total of 15 randomized clinical trials comparing different doses of oxytocin bolus and infusion used after caesarean delivery have met the selection criteria. Conclusion—oxytocin bolus 0.5–3 UI is considered an effective prophylactic dose. Recommended effective prophylactic oxytocin infusion dose is 7.72 IU/h but it is unanswered whether we really need a prophylactic infusion of oxytocin if we choose effective bolus dose size and rate. Adverse hemodynamic effects were observed when a 5 UI oxytocin bolus was used. However topics such as bolus dose size infusion dose size and requirement as well as bolus injection rate still remain unanswered. The doses that are recommended in the guidelines of peripartum hemorrhage prophy- laxis are not conﬁrmed by randomized controlled double-blind trials and more research should cover this topic. Keywords: oxytocin uterine contraction caesarean delivery hemorrhage 1. IntroductionEarly postpartum hemorrhage can occur if oxytocin is not used or if the dose of its bolus or infusion is too small. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist deﬁnes early (primary) postpartum hemorrhage as at 1000 mL or more of total blood loss or loss of blood accompanied by signs and symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 h following the delivery including intrapartum loss [1]. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists divides it into minor (500–1000 mL) and major (1000 mL and more) categories. They also deﬁne late (secondary) postpartum hemorrhage as abnormal or excessive bleeding later than 24 h post-birth but no later than 12 weeks [2]. Parturient hemorrhage has been the main cause of maternal morbidity and mortality for many years all over the world. Postpartum hemorrhage is one of the most common complications after caesarean delivery which is an important surgical intervention performed in obstetric practice. This has to be considered because caesarean delivery rates in the developing world countries keep getting higher [3 4]. Minimizing the amount of blood lost during caesarean delivery has a great beneﬁt to decrease postoperative morbidity and to decrease the risks associated with blood transfusions. The routine use of oxytocin correlates with a signiﬁcant reduction in the occurrence of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) [5–7]. Finding an optimal dose of oxytocin in patients undergoing caesarean delivery is a problem of great importance because it is mandatory to achieve an adequate balance be-Int. J. Environ. Res.

The aim of this review was to analyze the randomized controlled trials and to ﬁnd the best and lowest possible prophylactic dose of oxytocin during caesarean delivery (CD). 2.

Study Selection ProcessThe research yielded 813 results extracted from one database. All duplicates were removed 526 articles were checked manually for relevance by screening their titles and abstracts. A total 120 results met the inclusion criteria but only 15 were included after a full-text review. Only full-text articles were selected because the information given in the abstract was not sufﬁcient for the thorough analysis. The randomized trials conducted in 2008–2020 which compared different doses of oxytocin or oxytocin and placebo given for patients during CD in order to investigate the effect of the drug on PPH and uterine contraction were analyzed. A total of 105 publications were excluded for reasons explained in Picture 1. 3.2. Characteristics of Included StudiesThose 15 selected trials could be divided into several groups: those that investigate different bolus dose (5 trials) those that investigate different infusion dose (9 trials) and those that investigate both (1 trial). A summary of the results of 15 analyzed studies is provided in Table 1. 3.3. Synthesis of ResultsAll 15 trials (bolus/infusion/both) included in this systematic review were investi- gated and compared in 4 categories: PPH and blood loss uterine contraction and hemody- namics. The summarized results can be seen in Table 2. Butwick and colleagues compared 75 women divided into 5 groups to receive 0 0.5 1 3 or 5 IU oxytocin bolus intravenously diluted with 5 mL of 0.9% normal saline and administered over the time period of 15 s. Adequate uterine tonus was measured at 2 3 6 and 9 min. There were no signiﬁcant differences of adequate uterine tonus at 2 min between the groups. Sixty-six per cent of participants in the placebo group had adequate uterine tonus at 3 min and 100% of the parturient receiving 3 IU of oxytocin (p = 0.04). This study results indicated that adequate uterine tonus for patients during caesarean delivery can be achieved using a small 0.5–3 IU bolus of oxytocin plus continuous infusion of 250 mL normal saline with 10 IU of oxytocin [8]. Sartain with co-authors studied data of 80 women who were given 2 IU or 5 IU oxytocin bolus over 5–10 s and oxytocin infusion of at rate 10 IU/h for 4 h (40 IU totally) after delivery. No difference was found in blood loss uterine tone or need for additional uterotonic drugs. Nonetheless heart rate was found higher mean arterial pressure was found smaller and frequency of nausea and antiemetic drugs were bigger in the 5 IU oxytocin bolus group [9]. Somjit and co-authors compared 5 IU and 10 IU oxytocin bolus infused over 15 s and followed by the infusion with 20 IU of oxytocin (2.5 IU/h) impact on uterine contraction. Fewer patients who received 10 IU oxytocin bolus needed additional uterotonic agents. Blood loss and the uterine tone did not differ signiﬁcantly. They concluded that 5 IU was non-inferior to 10 IU oxytocin [10]. King with co-authors investigated the impact of 5 IU oxytocin bolus injected over 30 s on women who have at least one risk factor for uterine atony.,"(166.76699829101562, 169.89329528808594, 561.0219116210938, 752.9564208984375)","(2, 3)",1473
132,Prophylactic Dose of Oxytocin,One hundred and forty-three participants were divided into 2 groups: one group received 5 IU oxytocin bolus followed by 40 IU in 500 mL and 20 IU in 1 L saline oxytocin infusions and the second were given placebo bolus. The number of women requiring an additional dose of uterotonic agents was similar in both groups. They found a signiﬁcant difference in uterine tone after delivery which was bigger in the group who received 5 IU oxytocin bolus (p < 0.001). However this result was transient and disappeared after 5 min. Therefore this study revealed that there is no difference in PPH between women who receive oxytocin bolus and those who do not [11].

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021 18 5029 8 of 14Jonsson with colleagues investigated 5 and 10 IU of oxytocin IV bolus injected over 1 min impact on electrocardiography. Further doses of uterotonic drugs were available upon request. They found a signiﬁcant difference in the occurrence of ST depressions associated with oxytocin administration. The conclusion was that 5 IU has less effect on changes in ECG [12]. Kovacheva and colleagues from Boston conducted a study where one group of 30 women received 3 IU oxytocin bolus (over 15 s) and 500 mL saline infusion and the other group of the same size were given placebo bolus and 30 IU oxytocin in 500 mL infusion. Both groups received additional oxytocin according to uterine tone assessed between 3 min and 12 min if necessary. Women who received oxytocin bolus also received less oxytocin overall to achieve adequate uterine tone. No differences in hemodynamic or blood loss occurred [13]. Cecilia and colleagues conducted a trial of 271 women randomized into 2 groups: the ﬁrst group received 10 IU of oxytocin in 500 mL of ﬂuids over 2–4 h while the second group was given 30 IU of oxytocin in 1500 mL of ﬂuids over 8–12 h. The atonic uterus was seen in 1 patient from the ﬁrst group and 7 women from the second group (p = 0.03). Postoperative fall in blood pressure tachycardia and amount of blood loss during the operation and postoperative period and blood transfusions were similar between groups. The conclusion was that a low-dose oxytocin regimen is as effective as a high-dose oxytocin regimen in the prevention of PPH in the postoperative period after caesarean delivery [14]. Ghulmiyyah and colleagues randomly assigned 189 patients into 3 groups where women received 20 30 or 40 IU of oxytocin in 500 mL solution over 30 min. No signiﬁcant difference in the change of hemoglobin concentration was observed. This implies that 20 IU oxytocin diluted in 500 mL solution is an appropriate dose for the prevention of PPH [15]. Dufﬁeld with colleagues included 51 women: 24 patients received 10 IU of oxytocin in 1 L solution and 27 received 60 IU of oxytocin in 1 L solution. Additional bolus doses of 1 IU oxytocin were given after evaluating uterine contraction between 2 min and 20 min at 2 min intervals if requested. They did not observe any statistically signiﬁcant difference in excessive blood loss between groups concluding that both low and high infusion of oxytocin works in the same preventive regime [16]. Gungorduk and co-authors investigated 360 women who were given 5 IU of oxytocin bolus (over 5–10 s) and consecutive infusion with placebo and other 360 participants re- ceived 5 IU of oxytocin bolus and consecutive infusion of 30 IU of oxytocin.,"(308.02099609375, 233.69171142578125, 561.01904296875, 763.827392578125)","(7, 8)",1471
135,Prophylactic Dose of Oxytocin,Mean estimated blood loss (p < 0.001) greater than 1000 mL were signiﬁcantly less in the group of patients who were given 30 IU oxytocin infusion. More women in the placebo group required an additional uterotonic agent (p < 0.001) and blood transfusion (p = 0.03). This study revealed that 30 IU oxytocin infusion given after bolus lowers the blood loss after CD [17]. Kajendran with other researchers aimed to ﬁnd out the difference in blood loss between two groups of patients who were given 5 IU oxytocin bolus over 5–10 and 46 were given 20 IU oxytocin in 500 mL saline and the other half were given just 500 mL saline later. The blood loss in the group of 20 IU oxytocin infusion was signiﬁcantly less (p = 0.046). Visual estimation of blood loss made by the surgeon (p = 0.01) and anesthetist (p = 0.03) was also signiﬁcantly higher in the placebo group [18]. McLeod studied hemodynamic differences between 2 groups of women: both groups were given 5 UI oxytocin bolus over 3 min and 39 patients received 30 UI oxytocin infusion or 35 women were given placebo infusion. There were no signiﬁcant differences between groups during the 4-h study period. An additional oxytocin infusion after the bolus does not have a signiﬁcant impact on patient hemodynamic [19]. Murphy with other scientists compared the blood loss of 110 women divided in the same 2 groups as McLeod did. They favored the group with oxytocin infusion be- cause the blood loss was lower PPH occurred rarely and almost none needed additional uterotonic agent [20]. Sheehan with co-authors conducted a study of 2058 women who received 5 IU bolus over 1 min but half of them were given 40 IU oxytocin infusion ant others wereInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021 18 5029 9 of 14given a placebo infusion. No difference was found in PPH between groups (p = 0.86). There was a signiﬁcant difference in uterotonic agent need it was higher in the placebo group (p < 0.001) [21]. Qian and others conducted a trial in 2018 to ﬁnd out the rate of oxytocin infusion. All 150 women received 1 IU bolus of oxytocin followed by an oxytocin infusion at 0 1 3 5 8 IU/h. They found a 95% effective dose to be 7.72 IU/h and that the total oxytocin dose administered after delivery could be decreased if an infusion of oxytocin is given [22]. 4. DiscussionProphylactic uterotonic agents can prevent PPH and are routinely recommended. A systematic Cochrane review on uterotonic agents which included 196 clinical trials (135 559 women) and was published in 2018 concluded that oxytocin is effective for preventing peripartum hemorrhage when compared with placebo or no treatment. Er- gometrine plus oxytocin combination misoprostol plus oxytocin combination and car- betocin may have some additional desirable effects compared with oxytocin but the combination of two drugs is associated with more frequent side effects [23]. The main concern related to this topic is that there is not one opinion on what dosage of the uterotonic drug should be administered to prevent uterine atony and PPH. Despite the fact that oxytocin is used in everyday obstetric practice it seems that it is used empirically. The guidelines present a wide variety of oxytocin bolus doses and different infusion dose and rate and are based on expert opinion mostly that means that recommendations are not strong. The current WHO recommendation published in 2018 for preventing PPH is 10 IU of intramuscular or intravenous oxytocin for the prevention of PPH for all births. That dose is not related to a high rate of side effects and it also can be divided into a smaller intravenous bolus and an infusion. A rapid intravenous bolus injection must be avoided. One of the important research priorities indicated by WHO is the identiﬁcation of the optimal regimen of intravenous oxytocin at caesarean section [24]. A study conducted in Canada in 2016–2017 showed that for both high- and low- risk CD participants doctors use 5 IU IV oxytocin bolus although the range differs from 3 to 10 IU. In addition to bolus they also use an infusion: 20 IU (range 20–40)/L for low-risk CD and 40 IU (range 20–60)/L for high-risk CD [25]. This study inspired the release of a newly updated guideline in Canada. However the same recommendation concerning CD remained as in the 2009 version stating that 100 µg of carbetocin should be given as an IV bolus over 1 min instead of continuous oxytocin infusion [26] The. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also released updated recommendations for postpartum hemorrhage in 2017. But prevention of uterine atony was not discussed separately the closest recommendation was 10 IU of oxytocin bolus IV [27]. NATA consensus statements on prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage were issued in 2019. They rec- ommended administering an adjusted 5–10 IU intravenous oxytocin dose as the preferred preventive treatment [28]. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in the United Kingdom released updated recommendations for the prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage in 2016. They recommend the same 5 IU oxytocin dose by slow IV injection [5]. Guidelines released in France in 2015 stated that for prevention of postpartum hemorrhage after CD should be used 5–10 IU of oxytocin dose injected slowly (at least one-minute) IV [29]. It is very important to remember the fact that oxytocin is used for uterine atony prophylactics for most obstetric patients as supplementation of endogenous oxytocin. Carvalho dose-ﬁnding study results revealed that bolus should be only 0.35 IU but it should be followed by oxytocin infusion [30]. Balki and co-authors compared 30 women who were given 0.5 IU/mL IV oxytocin after the delivery. If the patient did not respond adequately to the initial bolus of oxytocin the initial dose for the next patient was increased by 0.5 IU. All patients received 20 IUInt. J.

136,Prophylactic Dose of Oxytocin,Res. Public Health 2021 18 5029 10 of 14oxytocin in 1 L saline. All patients who received 3.5 IU initial oxytocin dose showed adequate uterine response within 1–2 min. An important fact is that all parturients were given oxytocin before CD for a minimum of 2 h so the sensitivity of oxytocin receptors could be reduced. This study indicated that women undergoing CD for labor arrest require approximately 3 IU of oxytocin as a bolus to achieve adequate uterine contraction and continuous oxytocin infusion of 20 IU in 1 L saline after that [31]. These two studies revealed that an adequate dosage of oxytocin bolus can be as small as 3 IU or even less and an additional continuous infusion of oxytocin is needed. The previous oxytocin administration has no inﬂuence on the dose. A cross-sectional study carried out by Beiranvand et al. concluded that the minimum effective dose is 1 IU and in those in labor progress 1–1.5 IU both followed by 20 IU oxytocin in 1000 mL infusion [32]. The previously mentioned up-down sequential method study of Carvalho also resulted in a small minimum effective dose. We analyzed 5 studies investigating superior bolus dose. The four trials comparing constant continuous infusion of oxytocin and different bolus doses [10–13] two of them had the placebo group [10 13] found that smaller bolus dose or even no bolus dose has the same effect as the bigger one. Sartain concluded that 2 IU is superior to 5 IU espe- cially if hemodynamics was analyzed [11]. In the study of Butwick more than a half of patients in the placebo group didn’t require a bolus dose [10] which is also conﬁrmed by King his study revealed that there is no difference in PPH between women who receive oxytocin bolus and those who do not [13]. Jonsson conducted a trial without continuous infusion and also concluded that a smaller dose has lower incidence of cardiovascular side effects [14]. The cardiovascular effect of oxytocin is very important. It is detected that 10 IU oxytocin bolus may cause temporary hypotension and tachycardia as well as myocardial ischemia [33]. Therefore when comparing the cardiovascular system response to oxytocin dosage a lower strategic tactic should be approached. Both Cecilia Ghulmiyyah and partly King investigated the effect of oxytocin infusion without bolus dose. All of them found that the bolus of oxytocin is not necessary to achieve adequate and wanted uterine contraction and prevent PPH and the smaller dose of oxytocin (10–20) given as continuous infusion has the same effect as the bigger one [13 16 17]. This should also be taken into the consideration as previously discussed cardiovascular changes are observed almost in every patient given at least 5 IU bolus of oxytocin so the strategy of using only the infusion of oxytocin could be further researched or bolus dose should be as small as possible. The inclusion criteria met only one study investigating different bolus doses and continuous infusion of oxytocin. Kovacheva found out that the clinical effect is similar but additional doses of oxytocin and side effects are lower in the bolus group. The results suggest that prophylactic bolus dose is sufﬁcient [15]. The possibility to avoid the infusion dose helps to reduce the total dose of oxytocin. Dufﬁeld compared low and high doses of oxytocin given as a continuous infusion. That study conﬁrmed the previously mentioned result that both low (10 IU) and high (60 IU) infusion of oxytocin works in the same preventive regime [18]. Although Dufﬁeld says that both high and low-dose infusions work in the same way receptor overstimulation should be taken into the consideration. It is known that clinical use of high-dose of oxytocin infusion longer than 3 to 4 h may diminish the response of uterus tonus to oxytocin [34]. Robinson and colleagues in their study about oxytocin-induced desensitization of the oxytocin receptor concluded that oxytocin-induced desensitization of myocytes to oxytocin stimulation occurred over a clinically relevant time frame (4.2 h). Continued responsiveness of the cells to prostaglandin stimulation after 6 h of oxytocin pre-treatment indicated that post-receptor signaling pathways were maintained which indicates that the oxytocin receptor is likely involved in the mechanism of myocyte desensitization to oxytocin stimulation [34]. Especially if as high as 60 IU doses of oxytocin were used to prevent PPH. High doses work in the same way as low ones doInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021 18 5029 11 of 14because receptors cannot bind more hormone molecules to themselves meaning that there is no actual effect on uterine contraction after infusing oxytocin for too long and too much. We included ﬁve studies that had a very similar design. The bolus dose of oxytocin 5 IU was given and it was followed by infusion with placebo or oxytocin. Oxytocin dose ranged between studies from 20 to 40 IU. The conclusion is that additional oxytocin infusion lowers the risk of PPH reduces the need for additional uterotonic agents and does not have a signiﬁcant impact on patients’ hemodynamic [19–23]. The discussion remains if and when the oxytocin given as an infusion is for prophylactic or for treatment of uterine atony because the infused oxytocin dose in mentioned studies is more appropriate for uterine atony treatment. The trials investigating the oxytocin effect on uterine tonus during CD have superiority over studies conducted in natural delivery because there is a possibility to evaluate real uterine tonus visually and by palpation and to ﬁnd out the smallest effective dose of the hormone. One more point for discussion is the duration of oxytocin infusion. It is different and ranges from one hour till 24 h between studies. We should take into account that a long-lasting infusion could reduce the sensitivity of oxytocin receptors as mentioned before and oxytocin could lose its power in the case of real uterine atony. Further one more unanswered question is what duration of continuous infusion should be considered as prophylactic. It is known that clinical use of high-dose of oxytocin infusion longer than 3 to 4 h may diminish the response of uterus tonus to oxytocin [34]. The only study of Qian discusses prophylactic oxytocin infusion dose.,"(36.0, 52.109195709228516, 561.0193481445312, 761.0264282226562)","(10, 11)",1472
137,Prophylactic Dose of Oxytocin,They found a 95% effective dose to be 7.72 IU/h and that the total oxytocin dose administered after delivery can be decreased if the infusion of oxytocin is given [24]. The international consensus statement on the use of uterotonic agents during caesarean section was published in 2019. Researchers from 8 different countries reached an agreement that oxytocin is the ﬁrst-line drug in both elective and intrapartum CD. For the ﬁrst one bolus of 1 IU oxytocin and infusion starting at 2.5–7.5 IU/h is recommended. For the latter 3 IU oxytocin bolus over ≥30 s and infusion starting at 7.5–15 IU/h was decided [35]. Oxytocin given in very high doses change the mean level of arterial blood pressure in an opposing manner however under basal physiological conditions oxytocin does not contribute to blood pressure maintenance [36]. The hypotensive action of oxytocin demonstrated in animal models is believed to be mediated by the direct effect on oxytocin receptors in the heart and the indirect effect of the release of atrial natriuretic peptide brain natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide in the cardiovascular tissues [30]. This hormone has widely known cardiovascular side-effects mostly in decreasing blood pressure by causing peripheral vasodilation increasing the HR cases of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias. Thomas with his colleagues examined the effect of 5 IU bolus and 5 IU oxytocin infusion over 5 min. Both heart rate and blood pressure were lower in the bolus group meaning that bolus should be injected slower than it is widely used [37]. Langesaeter et al. with invasive monitoring (LiDCOPlus® monitor) in healthy preg- nant women observed an increase in cardiac index decreased systemic vascular resistance and systolic blood pressure (range of 36–62 mmHg) 45 s after oxytocin injection [38]. This same group of authors studied 18 patients with preeclampsia who underwent ce- sarean section. With the same monitoring as the previous study (LiDCOPlus®) connected to the radial artery of patients the authors found an increased heart rate and decreased systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure in all patients receiving oxytocin (5 IU) after delivery [39]. The hemodynamic instability that can occur during postpartum hemor- rhage may not be solely due to hypovolemia but the association of both hypovolemia and use of oxytocin bolus [40]. This review has several limitations. We could apply more strict inclusion criteria and include only randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials. The meta-analysis would provide more reliable results and conclusions it’s an option for future work. Most studies mentioned the rate of bolus injection and it ranges from 5 s till 3 min [10–15 19–21 23 24]. Further research investigating prophylactic bolus dose infusion rate isInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021 18 5029 12 of 14necessary. It is possible that the slower bolus infusion rate could reduce the frequency of side effects or the request of additional doses of uterotonic drugs or even the necessity of oxytocin prophylactic infusion. 5. ConclusionsOxytocin is the routinely used and effective uterotonic drug but the unanswered topic still remains the bolus dose size infusion dose size and requirement and bolus injection rate. The doses that are recommended in the guidelines of peripartum hemorrhage prophylaxis are not conﬁrmed by randomized controlled double-blind trials and are only supported by expert opinion and studies with low evidence rates. Oxytocin bolus 0.5–3 UI is considered an effective prophylactic dose. The effective prophylactic oxytocin infusion dose is 7.72 I U/h. However it is unanswered whether this prophylactic infusion dose of oxytocin is required if an effective bolus dose size and rate are chosen. In the cases we use an oxytocin infusion we should separate if it is the prophylactic infusion or the treatment of atony. Adverse hemodynamic effects were observed when a 5 UI oxytocin bolus was used. This must be taken into consideration especially among female patients with any pre-existing heart conditions. One of the important research priorities is the identiﬁcation of the optimal regiment of intravenous oxytocin at caesarean section.

Abstract OBJECTIVE: To identify and quantify risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage. DATA SOURCES: PubMed CINAHL EMBASE Web of Science and and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for English language studies with no restrictions on date or location. Studies included randomized trials prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case–control studies of pregnant patients who developed atonic postpartum hemorrhage and reported at least one risk factor. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Title abstract and full-text screening were performed using the Raayan web application. Of 1 239 records screened 27 studies were included in this review. Adjusted or unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) relative risks or rate ratios were recorded or calculated. For each risk factor a qualitative synthesis of low and moderate risk of bias studies classifies the risk factor as definite likely unclear or not a risk factor. For risk factors with sufficiently homogeneous definitions and reference ranges a quantitative meta-analysis of low and moderate risk of bias studies was implemented to estimate a combined OR. TABULATION INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Forty-seven potential risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage were identified in this review of which 15 were judged definite or likely risk factors. The remaining 32 assessed risk factors showed no association with atonic postpartum hemorrhage or had conflicting or unclear evidence. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of postpartum hemorrhage occurs in the absence of recognized risk factors. Many risk factors for atonic hemorrhage included in current risk- assessment tools were confirmed with the greatest risk conferred by prior postpartum hemorrhage of any etiology placenta previa placental abruption uterine rupture and multiple gestation. Novel risk factors not currently included in risk-assessment tools included hypertension diabetes and ethnicity. Obesity and magnesium were not associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this review. Corresponding author: Holly B.

Postpartum hemorrhage affects 3–10% of deliveries and accounts for nearly 20% of maternal deaths worldwide.1 2 Although there are many etiologies uterine atony is the most common and accounts for nearly 70% of cases.3 Patients who experience postpartum hemorrhage can have increased morbidity and mortality which can be attenuated by identifying patients at risk early preparation and increased vigilance.1 4 Risk stratification for postpartum hemorrhage is commonly performed using an assessment tool from one of several organizations such as the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative  Association of Women’s Health Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses or the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.5–7 Although these risk-assessment tools have the support of major medical societies recent evidence suggests that the tools have only moderate predictive value for severe hemorrhage in the highest risk groups and that a significant portion of hemorrhages (up to 43%) occur in those deemed low risk.8 9 This limitation may be partly due to the tools’ development via expert consensus opinion and a lack of systematically reviewed evidence to support or refute the included risk factors. A recently published meta-analysis that evaluated the association between maternal demographics and comorbidities and postpartum hemorrhage evaluated only four potential risk factors and found body mass index nulliparity and hypertensive disorders to confer risk of postpartum hemorrhage.11 Additionally existing tools assess the risk of all postpartum hemorrhage etiologies simultaneously which may confound attempts at risk prediction because each etiology of postpartum hemorrhage is likely associated with different risk factors. Furthermore current tools fail to account for the relative contribution of each risk factor or to provide mechanisms to quantify risk for a given patient when more than one risk factor is present. Because each etiology of postpartum hemorrhage likely has a unique set of risk factors evaluating each etiology separately may improve the ability to delineate individual patient risk. The systematic identification and quantification of risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage may allow the development of more reliable weighted risk- stratification tools. Thus this systematic review aimed to identify risk factors that increase the odds of a patient developing postpartum hemorrhage due only to uterine atony after vaginal or cesarean delivery.

Case reports case series and unpublished meeting abstracts were excluded. Two blinded authors screened abstracts and a third blinded author resolved conflicts. Full-text articles were obtained for all included abstracts. Full-text article review was conducted by the same two blinded authors with conflicts resolved in the same manner. Title abstract and full-text screening were performed using the Raayan web application.12The risk of bias for each included study was assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies.13 This tool was chosen because of the nonrandomized nature of all included studies as well as its scope in assessing multiple sources of bias  including those related to selection performance detection attrition and reporting. Six domains of risk of bias were assessed including: 1) selection of participants 2) confounding variables 3) measurement of exposure 4) blinding of outcome assessments 5) incomplete outcome data and 6) selective outcome reporting. Bias scoring proceeded after training each scorer on the assessment tool to ensure good inter-rater reliability correlation. Two authors (D.H.C. H.B.E.) independently assessed the risk of bias for each study with disagreements resolved by a third blinded author (J.R.B.). Studies were found to have a low risk of bias if they attained a low-risk classification in all six evaluated domains. Studies were considered a moderate risk of bias if at least one domain was rated unclear risk (but no domains were rated high risk). Finally studies were found to have a high risk of bias if at least one domain was rated high risk. All data were collected independently by co-investigators into a study spreadsheet and verified by a separate author. In addition to baseline study characteristics including country of origin study design the number of patients and inclusion and exclusion criteria data were collected on all risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage reported in the study. For each risk factor adjusted or unadjusted odds ratios (aOR uOR) relative risks (aRR  uRR) or rate ratios (arr urr) were recorded when available. If not explicitly reported uOR and 95% CI were calculated with a 2×2 table using the number of patients with and without a given risk factor who developed atonic postpartum hemorrhage.14 The primary outcome assessed in all studies was the OR RR or rr of risk factors associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. For each identified risk factor low and moderate risk of bias studies were synthesized qualitatively to label each risk factor as definite likely unclear or not a risk factor based on the number of total studies evaluating the factor and percentage ofEnde et al.

For risk factors with sufficiently homogeneous definitions and reference ranges a quantitative meta-analysis of low and moderate risk of bias studies was implemented to estimate a combined OR. The inverse variance random effects method was used for meta-analysis.15 This method requires only effect estimates (ie OR or risk ratios) and their SEs. The SEs were estimated by backtransforming the 95% confidence limits using the standard normal distribution. The DerSimonian-Laird estimator was used to estimate the between-study variance in effects.16Owing to the rarity of uterine atony (and thus the near-equivalence of the OR and RR)  studies that reported a risk ratio were included. Adjusted and unadjusted risk ratios and ORs were included. The I2 statistic and a P-value against the null hypothesis (ie I250) are reported for each subgroup. The I2 statistic represents the percentage of variability in the effect estimates that is attributable to study heterogeneity (compared with sampling heterogeneity). RESULTS The database search revealed 1 977 total records and 1 239 records were screened after removing duplicates. After excluding 871 records based on title and abstract review 368 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility (Fig. 1). Twenty-seven studies reported data for at least one risk factor for atonic postpartum hemorrhage and were included in the narrative summary. Of those 19 studies contributed data to the qualitative synthesis and 13 to the meta-analysis. Table 1 summarizes the study design patient population study definitions of postpartum hemorrhage and uterine atony and the risk factors assessed in the included studies. The scoring for risk of bias for each study is reported in Figure 2. A total of 47 unique risk factors were identified in the search: 15 relating to maternal history or demographics 11 to maternal comorbidities six pregnancy-related factors eight labor- related factors and seven delivery-related factors. For qualitative comparison the authors characterized each risk factor as definite likely unclear or not a risk factor based on the number of low and moderate risk of bias studies that showed statistically significant evidence that the risk factor was associated with atony (Box 1). Six variables were found to be definite risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage based on either all low and moderate risk of bias studies showing a positive association (if at least three studies) or the majority of low and moderate risk of bias studies showing a positive association (if at least five studies). An additional nine variables were deemed likely associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage  and these included being of Hispanic ethnicity nulliparity hypertensive diseases of pregnancy multiple gestation chorioamnionitis uterine rupture predelivery oxytocin exposure induction of labor and instrumented vaginal delivery.

DISCUSSION This systematic review highlights several previously unrecognized risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage that are not included in current risk-assessment tools and it questions whether other risk factors used in current tools are in fact supported by published evidence. This review also provides further evidence supporting the validity of many risk factors already included in risk-stratification tools and provides quantitative estimates of their contribution to atonic postpartum hemorrhage risk.,"(150.0039825439453, 123.87399291992188, 522.2420654296875, 431.2139892578125)","(3, 5)",1477
143,Risk Factors for Atonic Postpartum Hemorrhage,Although some risk factors presented may cause postpartum hemorrhage independently for example genital tract trauma or abnormal placentation these factors also appear to contribute to uterine atony  and thus are captured in this review. Perhaps most importantly current risk-assessment tools fail to include some definite or likely risk factors that appear to be well-established in the literature. Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.23 95% CI 1.20–1.25) and Asian race (OR 1.39 95% 1.33–1.46) were associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this review and are missing from current risk-assessment tools. The ORs for ethnicity and race are comparable with those for commonly cited risk factors including induction of labor (OR 1.23 95% 1.10–1.39) and macrosomia (OR 1.46  95% 1.35–1.57). Given the mounting evidence of disparities in the care of minority women  we may be failing to anticipate the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage in these populations.17 These associations do not imply causation and it is unclear whether the underlying mechanism of these relationships are biological social or a byproduct of disparities or systematic racism.18 Specific attention must be paid when including race or ethnicity in risk-prediction systems because recent evidence suggests that these algorithms may perpetuate health care disparities.19 20Hypertensive disease (OR 1.84 95% 1.45–2.33) and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.22 95% 1.08– 1.39) both of which are known to be associated with vascular and perfusion abnormalities  also emerged as previously underappreciated risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage. 21–23 We hypothesize that the vascular pathophysiology of these diseases may contributeEnde et al. Page 5Obstet Gynecol. Author manuscript available in PMC 2021 August 04. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript directly to the development of atony and hemorrhage however genetic susceptibility to both atony and hypertension or diabetes in specific patient populations may also explain this association and certainly warrants further investigation.24 25 Interestingly high vaginal lacerations and cervical trauma are not included in current risk-assessment tools. However  high vaginal and cervical lacerations demonstrated higher OR than either instrumented delivery or perineal trauma both of which are included in the Association of Women’s Health Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses’ risk-stratification tool.6 Although nulliparity and prolonged first stage of labor were found to be associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage and are not included in the current risk-assessment tools they may be associated with other risk factors that are included such as induction of labor oxytocin use and chorioamnionitis. Of these factors chorioamnionitis demonstrated the highest OR of 1.93 (95% CI 1.56–2.39) and may contribute significantly to an increased risk associated with nulliparity or prolonged first stage of labor. Finally uterine rupture was found to be associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Although not specifically described in the studies that reported this association hemorrhage attributable to uterine atony presumably occurred after repair of the uterine defect. Additionally some risk factors currently included in risk-assessment tools are not supported by this literature review of atonic postpartum hemorrhage although an association with other etiologies of postpartum hemorrhage would not be captured by this study. Prolonged second stage of labor (which is included in nearly all risk-assessment tools) did not emerge as a definite risk factor for atonic postpartum hemorrhage in our systematic review and meta-analysis with combined OR 1.10 (95% CI 0.82–1.48). Polyhydramnios did not emerge as a risk factor for atonic postpartum hemorrhage in quantitative analysis with combined OR 1.29 (95% CI 0.94–1.76) despite the historical identification of polyhydramnios as a cause of atonic postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine overdistention. Macrosomia and multiple gestation which are implicated by a similar mechanism did demonstrate increased risk with combined OR of 1.46 (95% CI 1.35–1.57) and 2.16 (95% CI 1.53–3.06)  respectively. Uterine overdistention alone however may not fully explain the variability in the risk of atony that is observed between these three conditions. For example multiple gestation pregnancies are frequently due to in vitro fertilization which has been associated with increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage possibly due to abnormalities of placental implantation and endometrial function.26 Additionally there may be some underlying immunologic vascular or genetic pathophysiology that overlaps with infertility and atonic postpartum hemorrhage.27–30Obesity and magnesium exposure are additional factors included in most risk-assessment tools however neither showed associations with atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this review. It is possible that the underlying conditions (ie diabetes mellitus hypertension) are the real risk factors as discussed above leaving the clinical impression that obesity and magnesium increase postpartum hemorrhage risk and leading some studies to find a positive effect. Given the retrospective nature of most included studies however magnesium exposure and dosing may have been inadequately captured hindering the ability to demonstrate an association with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Ende et al. Page 6Obstet Gynecol. Author manuscript available in PMC 2021 August 04. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Cesarean delivery and uterine leiomyomas are included in the risk-assessment tools but were not found to be associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage by either qualitative or quantitative analysis. Because intrapartum cesarean delivery is associated with factors (eg  prolonged labor and oxytocin exposure) shown to increase the risk of atonic postpartum hemorrhage this may contribute to a positive association in studies or a clinical impression that cesarean delivery is significantly associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. The occurrence of leiomyomas varies significantly in size location vascularity and previous surgical interventions which may influence the ability to determine the significance of leiomyomas as a risk factor in published studies. Finally many risk factors already included in widely adopted risk-assessment tools are further confirmed in this systematic review as associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage —prior postpartum hemorrhage multiple gestation placental disorders (previa or abruption) chorioamnionitis predelivery oxytocin exposure induction of labor prolonged labor perineal trauma and instrumented vaginal delivery.,"(150.00205993652344, 305.8739929199219, 521.1799926757812, 419.2099914550781)","(5, 7)",1455
144,Risk Factors for Atonic Postpartum Hemorrhage,Although some of these factors (eg abnormal placentation birth canal trauma) are etiologies for postpartum hemorrhage themselves the evidence presented here suggests that they are additionally associated with the development of uterine atony. This evidence further supports the inclusion of these factors when stratifying risk and our data may help health care professionals improve tools by assigning a quantitative weight to risk factors with a stronger association with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally current tools likely can be further improved by more nuanced definitions of some factors shown to have a robust association with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. For example further delineation of genital tract trauma may be warranted although episiotomy or perineal tear (OR 1.67 95% 1.28–2.18) is included in some current risk-assessment tools high vaginal laceration and cervical laceration are not (OR 2.19 95% 1.13–4.24 and 5.70 95% 2.56–12.67 respectively). The data for oxytocin exposure which also are already included in current risk-assessment tools presented the most significant challenge in the interpretation of results for this systematic review. Although qualitative synthesis suggested an association between predelivery oxytocin exposure and atonic postpartum hemorrhage the meta-analysis failed to confirm the association (combined OR 1.15 95% 0.95–1.40). Importantly two low risk of bias studies were not included in the meta-analysis because of heterogeneity in defining the exposure and reference ranges (eg evaluating oxytocin per unit dose). With conflicting results it is essential also to consider the mechanism by which oxytocin likely contributes to atonic postpartum hemorrhage namely that tachyphylaxis to oxytocin occurs during labor  thereby decreasing efficacy of the primary drug used for the active management the third stage of labor.31–33 Further investigation is needed to determine the cut-offs for the amount or duration of oxytocin that leads to an increased risk of atony. Although the risk-assessment tools may be refined by adding keeping or removing risk factors the individual weights and whether each individually or in combination defines an individual patient’s postpartum hemorrhage risk as moderate or high remains undetermined. When preparing and allocating resources for potential postpartum hemorrhage the use of risk scores that weigh the variable contribution of risk factors may be preferable to the use of tools that merely collate a list of diagnoses with many associated or overlapping risk factors. Ende et al. Page 7Obstet Gynecol. Author manuscript available in PMC 2021 August 04. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript To this end recent headway has been made in using statistical modeling and machine learning to predict postpartum hemorrhage.34 Notably however a substantial proportion of postpartum hemorrhage occurs in the absence of recognized risk factors. The strengths of this systematic review include the systematic approach to identifying all publications that included risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage and the division of risk factors into maternal pregnancy-related labor-related and delivery-related conditions to provide a logical progression of possible etiologies of atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Finally we evaluated each variable both qualitatively and quantitatively to summarize a large number of studies in a comprehensive review. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis however must be considered in the context of several limitations. First we had to accept the authors’ definitions of atonic postpartum hemorrhage which varied from study to study. The most common definitions in large database studies were rather consistent using International Classification of Diseases codes for postpartum hemorrhage due to atony. The variability occurred primarily in the smaller studies which used definitions of postpartum hemorrhage that included estimated blood loss postpartum hemoglobin or hematocrit drop and clinical diagnosis with additional definitions for the diagnosis of atony including uterotonic administration medical team diagnosis or other surgical interventions. These definitions represent a spectrum of pathology and each study’s definition may have affected the magnitude of associations of any given risk factor. Second  because all authors were fluent only in English we restricted our search to English-language studies which contributed to publication bias. Third for thoroughness we did include in the narrative summary studies with a high risk of bias however we included only studies with a low or moderate risk of bias when evaluating each risk factor both qualitatively and quantitatively. Fourth the types of effect estimates reported and the factors used to adjust for potential confounding were heterogeneous across studies. Additionally nearly all reported ORs and RRs reflect weak associations (range 1–2) which are likely below the discriminatory ability of the included cohort and case–control studies. These observations may result from unmeasured bias or confounding.35 Lastly to summarize risk factors qualitatively we had to provide a unique definition to categorize a risk factor as definite  likely or unclear. Although these definitions were created de novo for this review a post hoc evaluation revealed that for those variables designated definite risk factors all (six of six) showed statistically significant combined OR. Of the variables designated likely eight of nine were amenable to meta-analysis and seven showed statistically significant increased odds of atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Finally 15 variables were classified as unclear risk factors with only six of those demonstrating data homogeneous enough for meta-analysis  and of those only one (macrosomia) demonstrated a statistically significant OR. In summary this systematic review and meta-analysis of risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony provides critical insights to help guide future obstetric care. By more narrowly defining our focus to only atonic postpartum hemorrhage we aimed to provide more definitive evidence supporting or refuting presumed risk factors given that each etiology of postpartum hemorrhage likely has a unique set of contributing factors. These findings should lead researchers and clinicians to refine current risk-assessment tools further. Future tools should include weighted values for risk factors or modeling risk levelsEnde et al.

PPH is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly one quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from PPH occur during the first 24 hours after birth: the majority of these could be avoided through the use of prophylactic utero- tonics during the third stage of labour and by timely and appropriate management. Improving health care for women during childbirth in order to prevent and treat PPH is an essential step towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The primary objective of this guideline therefore is to provide a foundation for the strategic policy and programme development needed to ensure the sustainable implementation of effective interventions for reducing the global burden of PPH. Guideline development methods The procedures used in the development of this guideline are outlined in the “WHO handbook for guideline development”1. Briefly these procedures are: (i) the identi- fication of questions related to clinical practice and health policy for which answers are needed (ii) the retrieval of up-to-date research-based evidence (iii) the as- sessment and synthesis of evidence (iv) the formulation of recommendations using input from a wide range of stakeholders and (v) the formulation of plans for the dissemination implementation impact evaluation and updating of the guideline. The scientific evidence for the recommendations was synthesized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodol- ogy. For each of the previous WHO recommendations on PPH (2007 and 2009) and for all the newly-added questions evidence profiles were prepared based on 22 up-to-date systematic reviews. The revised and new recommendations were devel- oped and adopted by an international group of experts who participated in the WHO Technical Consultation on the Prevention and Treatment of PPH held in Montreux  Switzerland 6–8 March 2012. The WHO Technical Consultation adopted 32 recommendations and these are shown in Boxes A B and C. For each recommendation the quality of the supporting evi- dence is graded as ‘very low’ ‘low’ ‘moderate’ or ‘high’. The contributing stake- holders qualified the strength of these recommendations by taking the quality of the evidence and other factors into account (including the values and preferences of stakeholders the magnitude of effect the balance of benefits versus disadvantages  resource usage and the feasibility of each recommendation). To ensure that each recommendation is correctly understood and used in practice additional remarks have also been included and these are noted in the full document below the recom- mendations. Readers should refer to these remarks in the full version of the guide- line if they are in any doubt about the meaning of each recommendation. 1 WHO handbook for guideline development. Geneva World Health Organization 2012. WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 4 Recommendations for PPH prevention The intrinsic contribution of each component of the ‘active management of the third stage of labour’ was examined in light of new available evidence and relevant recommendations were made. All women giving birth should be offered uterotonics during the third stage of labour for the prevention of PPH oxytocin (IM/IV 10 IU) is recommended as the uterotonic drug of choice. Other injectable uterotonics and misoprostol are recommended as alternatives for the prevention of PPH in settings where oxytocin is unavailable. The importance of controlled cord traction (CCT) was revisited because of new evidence. This intervention is now regarded as optional in settings where skilled birth attendants are available and is contraindicated in settings where skilled attendants do not assist with births. Early cord clamping is generally contraindicated. Continuous uterine massage is not recommended as an intervention to prevent PPH in women who have received prophylactic oxytocin  as it may cause maternal discomfort require a dedicated health professional and may not lead to a reduction of blood loss. However surveillance of uterine tonus through abdominal palpation is recommended in all women for early identification of postpartum uterine atony. In summary the Guideline Development Group (GDG) considered the use of uterotonics as the main intervention within the active man- agement of third stage of labour package. In this context the use of misoprostol for the prevention of PPH by community health care workers and lay health workers is supported in settings where skilled birth attendants are not present. The GDG also issued recommendations for reducing blood loss during the third stage of labour in caesarean sections. Oxytocin is the recommended uterotonic drug for the prevention of PPH in caesarean sections. Cord traction is recommended in pref- erence to manual removal when assisting placental delivery in caesarean sections. Recommendations for PPH treatment The use of uterotonics (oxytocin alone as the first choice) plays a central role in the treatment of PPH. Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH as soon as it is diagnosed and initial fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids is recommended. The use of tranexamic acid is advised in cases of refractory atonic bleeding or persistent trauma-related bleeding. The use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is recommended for refractory bleeding or if uterotonics are unavail- able. Bimanual uterine compression external aortic compression and the use of non-pneumatic anti-shock garments are recommended as temporizing measures until substantive care is available. If there is persistent bleeding and the relevant re- sources are available uterine artery embolization should be considered. If bleeding persists despite treatment with uterotonic drugs and other conservative interven- tions surgical intervention should be used without further delay.,"(70.86609649658203, 401.0037536621094, 527.1751708984375, 661.753662109375)","(7, 10)",1474
155,WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage,If the third stage of labour lasts more than 30 minutes CCT and IV/IM oxytocin (10 IU) should be used to manage the retained placenta. If the placenta is retained and bleeding occurs the manual removal of the placenta should be expedited. Whenever the manual removal of the placenta is undertaken a single dose of pro- phylactic antibiotics is recommended. The GDG also issued recommendations related to the organization of PPH care. Health facilities delivering maternity services should adopt formal protocols for the prevention and treatment of PPH and for patient referral. The use of PPH treatmentWHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 5 simulations for pre-service and in-service training programmes was recommended. Finally the GDG recommended that the use of uterotonics for the prevention of PPH should be monitored and a specific indicator was suggested. Box A: Recommendations for the prevention of PPH 1.

BackgroundPostpartum Haemorrhage (PPH) is commonly defined as a blood loss of 500 ml or more within 24 hours after birth while severe PPH is defined as a blood loss of 1000 ml or more within the same timeframe. PPH affects approximately 2% of all women who give birth: it is associated not only with nearly one quarter of all ma- ternal deaths globally but is also the leading cause of maternal mortality in most low-income countries. PPH is a significant contributor to severe maternal morbidity and long-term disability as well as to a number of other severe maternal conditions generally associated with more substantial blood loss including shock and organ dys- function. (1–3)Uterine atony is the most common cause of PPH but genital tract trauma (i.e. vagi- nal or cervical lacerations) uterine rupture retained placental tissue or maternal coagulation disorders may also result in PPH. Although the majority of women who experience PPH complications have no identifiable clinical or historical risk factors  grand multiparity and multiple gestation are associated with an increased risk of bleeding after birth. PPH may be aggravated by pre-existing anaemia and in such instances the loss of a smaller volume of blood may still result in adverse clinical sequelae. (4)During the second half of the 20th century a package of interventions performed during the third stage of labour became the cornerstone for the prevention of PPH. This approach became known as the “active management of the third stage of labour” and consisted initially of the following components: the administration of a prophylactic uterotonic after the delivery of a baby early cord clamping and cutting and the controlled traction of the umbilical cord. Uterine massage is also frequently included as part of the active management of the third stage of labour. In contrast to active management expectant management involves instead waiting for signs of placenta separation and allows for the placenta to be delivered sponta- neously or aided by nipple stimulation or gravity. Compared with expectant man- agement the active management of the third stage of labour is associated with a substantial reduction in the occurrence of PPH. (5)It is generally assumed that by preventing and treating PPH most PPH-associated deaths could be avoided. The prevention and treatment of PPH are therefore vital steps towards improving the health care of women during childbirth and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. To reach these objectives  health workers in developing countries should be given access to appropriate medi- cations and be trained in procedures relevant to the management of PPH. Countries also need evidence-based guidance to inform their health policies and improve their health outcomes. Given the availability of new scientific evidence related to the prevention and treat- ment of PPH the aim of this document is to revise previous WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PPH and to add new recommendations. The primary goal of this guideline is to provide a foundation for the implementation of strategic policy and programme developments for interventions shown to have been effective in reducing the burden of PPH. Health professionals responsible for de- veloping national and local protocols and health policies constitute the main target audience of this document. Obstetricians midwives general medical practitioners  health care managers and public health policy-makers particularly in under-re-WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 9 sourced settings are also targeted. The guidance provided is evidence-informed and covers topics related to the management of PPH that were selected and prioritized by an international multidisciplinary group of health care workers consumers and other stakeholders. This document establishes general principles of PPH care and it is intended to inform the development of protocols and health policies related to PPH. This document is not intended to provide a comprehensive practical guide for the prevention and treatment of PPH. 2. MethodsThis guideline is an update of the “WHO recommendations for the prevention of PPH” published in 2007 and the “WHO guidelines for the management of PPH and retained placenta” published in 2009 (6 7). This document represents WHO’s nor- mative support for using evidence-informed policies and practices in all countries. The guideline forms part of a WHO knowledge-to-action project entitled GREAT (Guideline development Research priorities Evidence synthesis Applicability of evidence Transfer of knowledge) (8) and was developed using standardized operat- ing procedures in accordance with the process described in the “WHO handbook for guideline development” (9). In summary the process included: (i) the identification of critical questions and critical outcomes (ii) the retrieval of the evidence (iii) the assessment and synthesis of evidence (iv) the formulation of recommendations and (v) planning for the dissemination implementation impact evaluation and updating of the guideline. Two technical groups have worked in the development of this guideline. A small operative group composed of staff from the WHO’s Department of Reproductive Health and Research and Department of Maternal Newborn Child and Adolescent Health (MCA) as well as two external experts (see Annex 1 – The guideline steer- ing group) and a larger group with international stakeholders including midwives  obstetricians neonatologists researchers experts in research synthesis experts in health care programmes and consumer representatives (the Guideline Development Group – GDG). The guideline steering group was formed in the very beginning of the project and reviewed the previous WHO guidelines on prevention and treatment of PPH (6 7). This group prepared a list of potential additional questions related to the prevention and treatment of PPH. Next the GDG reviewed and prioritized the draft questions. The guideline steering group then produced a list of all the questions to be addressed. This included both questions from the earlier versions of the guideline as well as new ones. The guideline steering group also adopted the outcomes used in the 2007 and 2009 guideline documents. These outcomes as before were rated on a scale from 1 to 9. A question or outcome was defined as ‘critical’ if it was given an average score of 7 or more.,"(76.785400390625, 735.7169799804688, 455.26898193359375, 699.3350830078125)","(12, 15)",1495
157,WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage,Questions and outcomes with a score of between 4 and 6 were considered ‘important but not critical’ while those with a score lower than 4 were not considered to be important for the purposes of the guideline  (Annex 2). WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 10 Cochrane systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were the pri- mary source of evidence for the recommendations2. Using the assembled list of questions and outcomes the guideline steering group identified Cochrane systematic reviews that were either relevant or potentially relevant and then evaluated wheth- er any needed updating. A review was considered to be outdated if the last specified date for new trial searches was two years ago or more or if there were relevant studies still awaiting assessment as identified by the standard search procedures of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Updates were performed using spe- cific standard search strategies. The corresponding authors of the outdated reviews were invited to update them within a specified time period. In instances in which the corresponding authors were unable to do so the updates were undertaken by members of the guideline steering group. The search strategies employed to identify the trials and the specific criteria for trial inclusion and exclusion are described in the individual systematic reviews. A systematic review of literature that included non-randomized trials was carried out by the guideline steering group members when randomized-trial data related to specific questions were scarce. The following procedures were used to extract the evidence for this guideline from each of these systematic reviews: first the most recent version of the Review Manager (RevMan) file was retrieved from the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Cochrane Group and customized to reflect the key comparisons and outcomes (those that were not relevant to the guideline were excluded). Then the RevMan file was exported to the GRADE profiler software (Grading of Recommendations Assessment  Development and Evaluation) and GRADE criteria were used to critically appraise the retrieved scientific evidence. Finally evidence profiles (in the form of GRADE tables) were prepared for each comparison. An online content management system devel- oped for the GREAT project namely the Guideline Production System was used to handle and share electronic files. The evidence presented in the GRADE tables was derived from a larger body of data extracted primarily from Cochrane reviews which in many cases contained multiple comparisons (Evidence Base (EB) Tables 1 to 70). Each GRADE table relates to one specific question or comparison but some GRADE tables do not contain data for all critical outcomes. This is because data for those outcomes were not available in the Cochrane reviews. The raw data which constitute the basis of the GRADE tables are not included in this document but readers interested in how these GRADE tables were constructed may request access to this information. The guideline steering group used the information presented in the GRADE tables to check if any existing recommendations (included in the 2007 or 2009 documents) needed to be revised  and to draft recommendations that related to the new questions. Each recom- mendation was allocated to a thematic module which included the narrative sum- maries of evidence and the relevant GRADE tables. The standardized criteria used in grading the evidence and the thematic modules (including the GRADE tables) are not included in this document. They have been published separately online in a document entitled “WHO recommendations for preventing and treating PPH: evidence base” (www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perina- tal_health/9789241548502/en). “The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Inter­ ventions” describes in detail the process of preparing and maintaining Cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of health care interventions. WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 11 A preliminary online consultation was held to review the draft recommendations. The draft recommendations and supporting evidence were made available to a large number of international stakeholders who were then asked to respond to an online survey. In addition the preliminary online consultation identified other previous recommendations that needed to be discussed at the WHO Technical Consultation on the Prevention and Treatment of PPH held in Montreux Switzerland 6–8 March 2012. A subset of the international group of experts (who had participated in the online consultations) and other additional experts were invited to attend the Techni- cal Consultation (see Annex 1 for a full list of participants). The draft recommen- dations the narrative summaries of evidence the GRADE tables for the new and previous recommendations and other related documents were provided in advance to participants. Balance worksheets were used during the Technical Consultation to summarize the values preferences and judgements made about the strength of the new and revised recommendations. Declaration of interest by participants in the WHO Technical Con- sultation According to WHO regulations all experts must declare their relevant interests prior to participation in WHO meetings. All GDG members and participants were therefore required to complete a Declaration of Interest Form before the meeting. These were reviewed by the guideline steering group before the group composition and invita- tions were finalized. The external advisers also verbally declared potential conflicts of interest at the beginning of the meeting. The procedures for the management of conflicts of interests were undertaken in accordance with the “WHO guidelines for declaration of interests (WHO experts)”. In summary all members of the GDG declared that they had no commercial or financial interests that were directly or indirectly related to the topic of the meeting/guideline. Seven members of the GDG were involved in academic work related to the topic of the guideline but this involvement was not considered to be a conflict of interest and the full participation of all the selected experts was deemed appropriate. A table summarizing the decla- rations of interest made by members of the GDG is included in Annex 1. Decision-making during the Technical Consultation At the beginning of the Technical Consultation the participants discussed and ad- opted a list of recommendations which needed to be addressed during the meeting. This included the new recommendations as well as previous recommendations that needed to be reviewed and possibly revised. The following protocol was used for the Technical Consultation: the meeting was structured to allow participants to discuss the proposed list of recommendations and these recommendations were revised as needed through group discussion. The final adoption of each recommendation was made by consensus – defined as the agree- ment by three quarters or more of the participants – provided that those who dis- agreed did not feel strongly about their position. Strong disagreements were record- ed as such in the guideline. If the participants were unable to reach a consensus  the disputed recommendation or any other decision was put to a vote. A recom- mendation or decision stood if a simple majority (more than half of the participants) voted in support of it unless the disagreement related to a safety concern in which case the WHO Secretariat would choose not to issue a recommendation at all. WHO staff attending the meeting external technical experts involved in the collectionWHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 12 and grading of the evidence and observers were not eligible to vote.,"(70.86609649658203, 440.7237548828125, 524.1351318359375, 176.15411376953125)","(15, 18)",1475
158,WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage,In addition to discussing the scientific evidence and its quality relevant applicability issues costs and other judgements were also taken into consideration when formulating the final recommendations. The strength of each recommendation was determined during the Technical Con- sultation. By default the strength of the recommendations discussed was aligned initially with the quality of the evidence (i.e. at the start of the discussion strong recommendations were based on evidence of ‘moderate’ and ‘high’ quality while weak recommendations were based on evidence of ‘low’ and ‘very low’ quality). In addition to the quality of the evidence the following factors were considered when determining the final recommendation and its strength: values and preferenc- es the magnitude of effect the balance of benefits versus disadvantages resource usage and feasibility. Values and preferences resource usage and the feasibility of each recommendation were based on the experience and opinion of the GDG mem- bers. Balance worksheets were used to note and synthesize these considerations (Annex 3 Boxes 1 to 8) and record the reasons for changes made to the default strength of the recommendations. Document preparation and peer review Prior to the Technical Consultation the guideline steering group prepared a prelimi- nary version of this document using a guideline reporting template which had been developed as part of the WHO’s GREAT project. The draft guideline was reviewed by Technical Consultation participants at the meeting in Montreux. During the meeting  the draft guideline was modified in line with participant deliberation and comments. Feedback received during the preliminary online consultation was also discussed and incorporated into the document where appropriate. After the meeting members of the guideline steering group worked to ensure that a revised version of the docu- ment accurately reflected the deliberations and decisions of the participants. The revised draft guideline document was sent to two external peer reviewers and their inputs were carefully evaluated by the guideline steering group and document revi- sions made accordingly. The guideline steering group refrained from making substan- tive changes after the meeting in Montreux to the guideline scoping (such as the further expansion of the guideline scoping) or to the recommendations. The revised version was returned electronically to those who had attended the Technical Consul- tation for their approval. 3. ResultsThis guideline includes 32 recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PPH. Seven of these recommendations are new while the others have been revised in light of new evidence. Most of the previous 2007 and 2009 recommendations remain unchanged in essence despite updates to the evidence base. The wording of the previous recommendations has been revised to enhance the clarity of the guidance provided. The recommendations included in this guideline are based on a total of 22 Cochrane systematic reviews summarized in 70 GRADE tables. Boxes 1 to 8 present the most up-to-date WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PPH. Where applicable remarks related to specific recommendations are also shown in these boxes and new recommendations are marked with asterisks. Narrative summaries of evidence supporting the recommendations are presentedWHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 13 in the electronic appendix together with the corresponding GRADE tables (see the “WHO recommendations for preventing and treating PPH: evidence base” at  www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/ 9789241548502/en). Box 9 presents statements related to topics for which accord- ing to the assessments of the GDG there was insufficient evidence to issue a recom- mendation. Balance worksheets summarizing the values preferences and judge- ments made about the strength of the recommendations are presented in Annex 3  Boxes 1 to 8. The development of these recommendations involved 130 stakeholders who par- ticipated in the online preliminary survey (representing all WHO regions) and 25 experts who participated in the WHO Technical Consultation. Recommendations for PPH prevention The contribution of each component of the ‘active management of the third stage of labour’ was examined in light of new available evidence and relevant recommenda- tions were made. Box 1 presents recommendations concerning the use of uteroton- ics for the prevention of PPH. All women giving birth should be offered uteroton- ics during the third stage of labour to prevent PPH and IM/IV oxytocin (10 IU) is recommended as the uterotonic drug of choice. Other injectable uterotonics (i.e. ergometrine/methylergometrine or the fixed drug combination of oxytocin and ergometrine) and misoprostol are recommended as alternatives for the prevention of PPH in settings where oxytocin is unavailable. Box 2 contains recommendations related to cord management and uterine massage. The importance of controlled cord traction (CCT) was revisited because of new evidence. This intervention is now regarded as optional in settings where skilled birth attendants are available and is contraindicated in settings where skilled attendants do not assist with births. Early cord clamping is generally contraindicated. Continuous uterine massage is not recommended as an intervention to prevent PPH for women who have received prophylactic oxytocin because the massage may cause maternal discomfort re- quire a dedicated health professional and may not lead to a reduction of blood loss. However surveillance of the uterine tonus through abdominal palpation is recom- mended for all women for the early identification of postpartum uterine atony. Table 1 summarizes the recommendation status of the individual components of the active management of the third stage of labour. In summary the GDG considered the use of uterotonics as the main intervention within the active management of third stage of labour package. In this context the use of misoprostol for the prevention of PPH by community health care workers and lay health workers is supported in settings where skilled birth attendants are not present. Recommendations for reducing blood loss during the third stage of labour in caesar- ean sections are presented in Box 3. Oxytocin is the recommended uterotonic drug for the prevention of PPH in caesarean sections. Cord traction is recommended in preference to manual removal when assisting placental delivery in caesarean sec- tions. Recommendations for PPH treatment The use of uterotonics (oxytocin alone as the first choice) plays a central role in the treatment of PPH (see Boxes 4 and 5). Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH as soon as it is diagnosed (see Box 6) and the initial fluid resus-WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 14 citation with isotonic crystalloids is recommended. The use of tranexamic acid is advised in cases of refractory atonic bleeding or persistent trauma-related bleed- ing (see Box 5). The use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is recommended for refractory bleeding or if uterotonics are unavailable.,"(141.7322998046875, 125.54278564453125, 526.0451049804688, 254.15411376953125)","(18, 20)",1475
159,WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage,Bimanual uterine compression  external aortic compression and the use of non-pneumatic anti-shock garments are recommended as temporizing measures until substantive care is available. If there is persistent bleeding and the relevant resources are available uterine artery emboli- zation should be considered. If bleeding persists despite treatment with uterotonic drugs and other conservative interventions surgical intervention should be used without further delay. If the third stage of labour lasts more than 30 minutes CCT and IV/IM oxytocin  (10 IU) should be used to manage the retained placenta. If the placenta is retained and bleeding occurs the manual removal of the placenta should be expedited. Whenever the manual removal of the placenta is undertaken a single dose of pro- phylactic antibiotics is recommended (see Box 7). The GDG also issued recommendations related to the organization of PPH care (see Box 8). Health facilities delivering maternity services should adopt formal proto- cols for the prevention and treatment of PPH and for patient referral. The use of PPH treatment simulations for pre-service and in-service training programmes was recommended. Finally the GDG recommended that the use of uterotonics for the prevention of PPH should be monitored and a specific indicator was suggested. The GDG found insufficient evidence to recommend one route over another for the prevention of PPH with oxytocin the use of recombinant factor VIIa for the treat- ment of PPH intraumbilical vein injection of oxytocin for treatment of retained placenta and the antenatal distribution of misoprostol. The GDG also found insuffi- cient evidence to recommend self-administration for the prevention of PPH and the measurement of blood loss over clinical estimation (see Box 9). WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 15 Box 1: Recommendations for the prevention of PPH – uterotonics 1. The use of uterotonics for the prevention of PPH during the third stage of labour is recom-mended for all births. (Strong recommendation moderate-quality evidence)2. Oxytocin (10 IU IV/IM) is the recommended uterotonic drug for the prevention of PPH. (Strong recommendation moderate-quality evidence) 3. In settings where oxytocin is unavailable the use of other injectable uterotonics (e.g. er-gometrine/methylergometrine or the fixed drug combination of oxytocin and ergometrine) or oral misoprostol (600 µg) is recommended. (Strong recommendation moderate-quality evidence)4. In settings where skilled birth attendants are not present and oxytocin is unavailable theadministration of misoprostol (600 µg PO) by community health care workers and lay health workers is recommended for the prevention of PPH. (Strong recommendation moderate- quality evidence)Remarks • Available comparisons are limited but a significant difference between the benefits of oxytocin and ergometrine is unlikely. These recommendations place a high value on avoiding the adverse effects of ergometrine and assume a similar benefit from using oxytocin and ergometrine for the prevention of PPH. • Caution should be exercised when opting for ergot derivatives for the prevention of PPH as these drugs have clear contraindications in women with hypertensive disorders. Thus it is probably safer to avoid the use of ergot derivatives in unscreened populations. • Misoprostol (600 õg PO) was regarded by the GDG as an effective drug for the prevention of PPH. How- õg PO) was regarded by the GDG as an effective drug for the prevention of PPH. How- PO) was regarded by the GDG as an effective drug for the prevention of PPH. How-ever the GDG considered the relative benefits of oxytocin compared to misoprostol in preventing blood loss as well as the increased adverse effects of misoprostol compared to oxytocin. The GDG acknowl- edged that there is no evidence to show that a 600 µg dose of misoprostol provides greater efficacy over a 400õg õg dose. Lower doses have a lower side-effect profi le but the effi cacy of lower doses of miso- õg õg dose. Lower doses have a lower side-effect profi le but the effi cacy of lower doses of miso- dose. Lower doses have a lower side-effect profile but the efficacy of lower doses of miso-prostol has not been evaluated sufficiently. • The recommendations concerning alternative uterotonics should not detract from the objective of mak- ing oxytocin as widely accessible as possible. • In view of past concerns regarding the community-level distribution of misoprostol and the potential for serious consequences of administration before birth the GDG places emphasis on training persons administering misoprostol and monitoring community distribution interventions with scientifically sound methods and appropriate indicators.

(Strong recommendation very-low-quality evidence)Remarks • Recommendations 5 and 6 are based on a large RCT in which oxytocin 10 IU was used for the prevention of PPH in all participants. Based on this evidence CCT was regarded as safe when applied by skilled birth attendants as it provides small beneficial effects on blood loss (average reduction of 11 ml on blood loss) and on the duration of the third stage of labour (average reduction of 6 minutes). The deci- sion to implement CCT in the context of a prophylactic uterotonic drug should be discussed by the care provider and the woman herself.,"(141.7322998046875, 125.54278564453125, 517.1199340820312, 474.0311279296875)","(20, 22)",1475
160,WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage,• If ergot alkaloids are used for the prevention of PPH then CCT to minimize placenta retention is re- garded as essential. • There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit or risk of CCT when used in conjunction with misoprostol. • CCT is the first intervention to treat retained placenta therefore the teaching of CCT in medical and midwifery curricula is essential. • The evidence base for recommendations for the timing of cord clamping includes both vaginal and cae- sarean births. The GDG considers this recommendation to be equally important for caesarean sections. • Delayed clamping should be performed during the provision of essential newborn care. For essential newborn care and resuscitation please refer to the WHO guidelines on neonatal resuscitation. (10)• The recommendations for the timing of cord clamping apply equally to preterm and term births. The GDG considers the benefits of delayed clamping for preterm infants to be particularly important. (Continued on next page) WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 17 • Some health professionals working in areas of high HIV prevalence have expressed concern regard- ing delayed cord clamping as part of management of the third stage of labour. These professionals are concerned that during placental separation a partially detached placenta could be exposed to maternal blood and this could lead to a micro-transfusion of maternal blood to the baby. It has been demonstrat- ed that the potential for maternal-to-child transmission of HIV can take place at three different points in time: micro-transfusions of maternal blood to the fetus during pregnancy (intra-uterine HIV transmis- sion) exposure to maternal blood and vaginal secretions when the fetus passes through the birth canal in vaginal deliveries (intra-partum transmission) and during breastfeeding (postnatal infection). For this reason the main intervention to reduce the maternal-to-child transmission is the reduction of mater- nal viral load through the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy childbirth and postnatal period. There is no evidence that delaying the cord clamping increases the possibility of HIV transmission from the mother to the newborn. Maternal blood percolates through the placental intervillous space through- out pregnancy with a relatively low risk of maternal fetal transmission before delivery. It is highly un- likely that separation of the placenta increases exposure to maternal blood and is highly unlikely that it disrupts the fetal placental circulation (i.e. it is unlikely that during placenta separation the newborn circulation is exposed to maternal blood). Thus the proven benefits of a 1 – 3 minute delay at least in clamping the cord outweigh the theoretical and unproven harms. Late cord clamping is recommended even among women living with HIV or women with unknown HIV status. • There is a lack of evidence regarding the role of uterine massage for PPH prevention when no uterotonic drugs are used or if a uterotonic drug other than oxytocin is used. • Although the GDG acknowledged that one small study reported that sustained uterine massage and clot expulsion were associated with a reduction in the use of additional uterotonics there is lack of robust evidence supporting other benefits. However the GDG considered that routine and frequent uterine tone assessment remains a crucial part of immediate postpartum care particularly for the optimization of early PPH diagnosis. • Based on the most recent evidence understanding of the contribution of each component of the active management of the third stage of labour package has evolved. The GDG considered that this package has a primary intervention: the use of an uterotonic. In the context of oxytocin use CCT may add a small benefit while uterine massage may add no benefit for the prevention of PPH. Early cord clamping is generally contraindicated. (Continued from previous page) WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 18 Box 3: Recommendations for the prevention of PPH in caesarean sections 11. Oxytocin (IV or IM) is the recommended uterotonic drug for the prevention of PPH in caesar-ean section. (Strong recommendation moderate-quality evidence)12. Cord traction is the recommended method for the removal of the placenta in caesarean sec-tion. (Strong recommendation moderate-quality evidence)Remarks • The GDG noted that in terms of blood loss there was not enough evidence to recommend oxytocin infusion over IV bolus injection. However due to concerns regarding adverse haemodynamic effects  the GDG considered that if an IV bolus injection is used a slow injection rate is preferred and a rapid injection rate should be avoided. • The GDG noted that the combination of an oxytocin infusion after an initial IV bolus of oxytocin after caesarean delivery reduces the need for additional uterotonic agents but does not affect the overall  occurrence of major obstetric haemorrhage. • The GDG noted that carbetocin is associated with a reduction in the use of additional uterotonic agents but with no difference in the occurrence of major obstetric haemorrhage. In addition the GDG noted that the use of carbetocin is considerably more expensive than oxytocin. This remark is equally appli- cable to vaginal deliveries.

Intravenous oxytocin is the recommended uterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH. (Strongrecommendation moderate quality evidence) 14. If intravenous oxytocin is unavailable or if the bleeding does not respond to oxytocin the useof intravenous ergometrine oxytocin-ergometrine fixed dose or a prostaglandin drug (includ- ing sublingual misoprostol 800 µg) is recommended. (Strong recommendation low-quality evidence)Remarks • The GDG recommended IV oxytocin as the first line uterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH including when women have already received this drug for the prophylaxis of PPH. • The GDG recognized that IV oxytocin may not be available in all settings.,"(76.785400390625, 409.5809326171875, 498.1479187011719, 315.42333984375)","(22, 25)",1497
161,WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage,It encourages health care decision-makers in these settings to strive to make oxytocin available. • In settings where IV oxytocin is unavailable to women who have received prophylactic IM oxytocin during the third stage of labour the GDG considered misoprostol to be a valid alternative. • If PPH prophylaxis with misoprostol has been administered and if injectable uterotonics are unavailable  there is insufficient evidence to guide further misoprostol dosing and consideration must be given to the risk of potential toxicity. • There is no added benefit to offering misoprostol simultaneously to women receiving oxytocin for the treatment of PPH (i.e. adjunct misoprostol). • The GDG noted that the two largest trials of misoprostol for the treatment of PPH (Winikoff 2010 Blum 2010) reported the use of a 800 μg dose administered sublingually. The majority of the GDG members agreed that 800 μg is an acceptable sublingual misoprostol dose for the treatment of PPH though some members of the GDG expressed concern related to the risk of hyperpyrexia associated with this dosage. • If IV oxytocin has been used for the treatment of PPH and the bleeding does not stop there is a paucity of data to recommend preferences for second line uterotonic drug treatment. Decisions in such situ- ations must be guided by the experience of the provider the availability of the drugs and by known contraindications. • In situations in which IM oxytocin can be administered and there is no possibility of IV treatment with ergot alkaloids/injectable prostaglandins there is a paucity of data to recommend a preference of IM oxytocin over misoprostol or other uterotonics. Decisions in such situations must be guided by the expe- rience of the provider the availability of the drugs and by known contraindications. Box 5: Recommendations for the treatment of PPH – fluid resuscitation and tranexamic acid 15. The use of isotonic crystalloids is recommended in preference to the use of colloids for theintravenous fluid resuscitation of women with PPH. (Strong recommendation low-quality evidence)16. The use of tranexamic acid is recommended for the treatment of PPH if oxytocin and otheruterotonics fail to stop the bleeding or if it is thought that the bleeding may be partly due to trauma. (Weak recommendation moderate-quality evidence)Remarks • Evidence for the recommendation of tranexamic acid was extrapolated from the literature on surgery and trauma which shows tranexamic acid to be a safe option for the treatment of trauma-related bleeding. WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 20 Box 6: Recommendations for the treatment of PPH – manoeuvres and other procedures 17. Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH. (Strong recommendation very-low-quality evidence) 18. If women do not respond to treatment using uterotonics or if uterotonics are unavailablethe use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is recommended for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evidence)19. If other measures have failed and if the necessary resources are available the use of uter-ine artery embolization is recommended as a treatment for PPH due to uterine atony. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evidence)20. If bleeding does not stop in spite of treatment using uterotonics and other available conserva-tive interventions (e.g. uterine massage balloon tamponade) the use of surgical interven- tions is recommended. (Strong recommendation very-low-quality evidence)21. The use of bimanual uterine compression is recommended as a temporizing measure untilappropriate care is available for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal delivery. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evidence)22. The use of external aortic compression for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony aftervaginal birth is recommended as a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evidence)23. The use of non-pneumatic anti-shock garments is recommended as a temporizing measureuntil appropriate care is available. (Weak recommendation low-quality evidence)24. The use of uterine packing is not recommended for the treatment of PPH due to uterineatony after vaginal birth. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evidence)Remarks • The GDG noted that the application of these interventions requires training and that maternal discom- fort and complications associated with these procedures have been reported. • Uterine massage as a therapeutic measure is defined as the rubbing of the uterus achieved through the manual massaging of the abdomen. This is typically sustained until the bleeding stops or the uterus con- tracts. The GDP considered that uterine massage should be started once PPH has been diagnosed. • The initial rubbing of the uterus and expression of blood clots are not regarded as therapeutic uterine massage. • When rating the recommendation #17 as ‘strong’ the low cost and safety of uterine massage were taken into account. • The use of balloon tamponade was considered by the GDG to be a measure that can potentially avoid surgery or as a temporizing measure while awaiting transfer to a higher level facility. The GDG acknowl- edges that balloon tamponade can be obtained with specific devices as well as with lower cost adapta- tions including those based on the use of condoms and surgical gloves. • The GDG noted that uterine artery embolization requires significant resources in terms of the cost of the treatment the facilities and the training of health care workers. • The GDG noted that conservative surgical approaches should be tried first. If these do not work they should be followed by more invasive procedures. Compression sutures for example may be attempted as a first intervention and if these fail then uterine utero-ovarian and hypogastric vessel ligation may be tried. If life-threatening bleeding continues even after ligation then a subtotal (otherwise known as supracervical) or total hysterectomy should be performed. • The GDG acknowledged that the level of health care provider skills will play a role in the selection and sequence of the surgical interventions. (Continued on next page) WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 21 • External aortic compression has long been recommended as a potential life-saving technique and me- chanical compression of the aorta if successful slows blood loss. The GDG placed a high value on this procedure as a temporizing measure in the treatment of PPH. • The GDG noted that research evaluating the potential benefits and harms of non-pneumatic anti-shock garments is ongoing.,"(76.785400390625, 294.17315673828125, 514.4290771484375, 204.6177978515625)","(25, 27)",1481
162,WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage,Based on the evidence available the GDG regarded non-pneumatic anti-shock gar- ments as a temporizing measure while transfer is awaited. • The GDG noted that there was no evidence of benefit of uterine packing and placed a high value on concerns regarding its potential harm. Box 7: Recommendations for the treatment of retained placenta 25. If the placenta is not expelled spontaneously the use of additional oxytocin (10 IU IV/IM) incombination with controlled cord traction is recommended. (Weak recommendation very- low-quality evidence)26. The use of ergometrine for the management of a retained placenta is not recommended asthis may cause tetanic uterine contractions which may delay the expulsion of the placenta. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evidence)27. The use of prostaglandin E2 alpha (dinoprostone or sulprostone) in the management of re-tained placenta is not recommended. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evidence)28. A single dose of antibiotics (ampicillin or first-generation cephalosporin) is recommended ifmanual removal of the placenta is practised. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evi- dence)Remarks • The GDG found no empirical evidence to support recommending the use of uterotonics for the manage- ment of a retained placenta in the absence of haemorrhage. The above recommendation was reached by consensus. • The WHO guide “Managing complications in pregnancy and childbirth” (WHO 2007) states that if a placenta is not expelled within 30 minutes after the delivery of a baby the woman should be diagnosed as having a retained placenta. Since there is no evidence for or against this definition the delay used before this condition is diagnosed is left to the judgement of the clinician. • The same WHO guide also suggests that in the absence of haemorrhage the woman should be observed for a further 30 minutes after the initial 30 minutes before the manual removal of the placenta is at- tempted. The GDG noted that spontaneous expulsion of the placenta can still occur even in the absence of bleeding. A conservative approach is therefore advised and the timing of the manual removal of the placenta as a definitive treatment is left to the judgement of the clinician. • The recommendation regarding the use of prostaglandin E2 is informed by a lack of evidence on this question and also by concerns related to adverse events particularly cardiac events. • Direct evidence of the value of antibiotic prophylaxis after the manual removal of the placenta was not available. The GDG considered indirect evidence of the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics from studies of caesarean section and abortion as well as observational studies of other intrauterine manipulations. • Current practice suggests that ampicillin or first-generation cephalosporins may be administered when the manual removal of the placenta is performed. • This question was identified as a research priority for settings in which prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely administered and those with low infectious morbidity. (Continued from previous page) WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 22 Box 8: Health Systems and Organization of Care recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PPH 29. The use of formal protocols by health facilities for the prevention and treatment of PPH isrecommended. (Weak recommendation moderate-quality evidence)30. The use of formal protocols for referral of women to a higher level of care is recommendedfor health facilities. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evidence)31. The use of simulations of PPH treatment is recommended for pre-service and in-service train-ing programmes. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evidence)32. Monitoring the use of uterotonics after birth for the prevention of PPH is recommended asa process indicator for programmatic evaluation. (Weak recommendation very-low-quality evidence)Remarks • Routine and frequent uterine tone assessment remains a crucial part of immediate postpartum care  particularly for optimizing the early diagnosis of PPH. • The GDG acknowledged that the implementation of formal protocols is a complex process which will require the local adaptation of general guidelines. • The GDG placed a high value on the costs of simulation programmes and acknowledged that there are different types of simulation programmes. Some programmes are hi-tech computerized and costly while others are less expensive and more likely to be affordable in low- and middle-income countries. The GDG identified improvement in communication between health care providers and patients and their family members as an important priority in the training of health care providers in PPH management. • The GDG recommended monitoring the use of prophylactic uterotonics. This recommendation is based on experience from other areas of health care particularly child health where content-based health indicators are common and regarded as useful for programmatic purposes. The suggested indicator is calculated as the number of women receiving prophylactic uterotonic drugs after birth divided by all women giving birth. WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 23 Box 9: Statements related to topics for which there is insufficient evidence to issue a recom- mendation A. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one oxytocin route over another for the prevention of PPH. B. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of recombinant factor VIIa for the treatment ofPPH. C. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of intraumbilical vein injection of oxytocin as atreatment for retained placenta. D. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the antenatal distribution of misoprostol to pregnantwomen for self-administration for the prevention of PPH. E. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the measurement of blood loss over clinical estimation ofblood loss. Remarks • The GDG noted that there are three ongoing trials in which the IV and IM routes for oxytocin administra- tion are being compared for the prevention of PPH. • The GDG considered there to be insufficient evidence to recommend the use of oxytocin infusion over IV bolus injection with regard to blood loss. However in light of concerns about the potential adverse haemodynamic effects the GDG considered that if IV bolus injection treatment is to be used then a slow injection rate is preferred and a rapid injection rate should be avoided. • In the context of PPH the GDP considered that the use of recombinant factor VIIa should be limited to women with specific haematological indications. The group regarded the recombinant factor VIIa as a potentially life-saving drug but noted that it is also associated with life-threatening side-effects. More- over recombinant factor VIIa is expensive and may be difficult to administer. • The GDG acknowledged that while there is a paucity of data to recommend intraumbilical vein injec- tion of oxytocin as a treatment for retained placenta the procedure itself has not been shown to cause harm and demonstrates a non-significant trend towards a lower risk of requiring the manual removal of the placenta.,"(76.785400390625, 172.5675048828125, 516.390869140625, 489.43243408203125)","(27, 29)",1488
163,WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage,• The GDG acknowledged that a number of countries have embarked on community-level programmes of misoprostol distribution and considered that this should be done in the context of research (where reli- able data on coverage safety and health outcomes can be collected). • The GDG noted that all trials included in the systematic review on the measurement of blood loss were conducted in developed countries and views the applicability of this evidence to low- and middle- income countries as very uncertain. WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 24 4. Research implicationsThe GDG identified important knowledge gaps that need to be addressed through primary research. In this guideline recommendations based on evidence quality that was rated as ‘very low’ or ‘low’ require further research. Conversely further re- search is not a priority for those recommendations based on evidence of ‘moderate’ or ‘high’ quality. Knowledge gaps identified in the 2007 and 2009 WHO documents were also reviewed. The identified knowledge gaps were prioritized by considering whether such research would be feasible innovative original likely to promote equity and contribute to the reduction of the burden of PPH. The main barriers to scaling up the intervention were also considered in this prioritization exercise. The GDG noted that research is either planned or ongoing for some of the research priorities identified. However there is no certainty that these investigations will provide conclusive results and the topics have therefore remained listed as re- search priorities in this document. Key research priority In settings where the use of injectable uterotonics is not feasible what are the ef- fects of antenatal distribution of misoprostol to pregnant women for self-administra- tion during the third stage of labour? Other research questions • What is the minimum effective dose of oxytocin for the prevention of PPH? • What are the effects of IM oxytocin (versus IV oxytocin) for the prevention of PPH? • Can oxytocin be administered safely by unskilled attendants? • What are the effects of buccal and sublingual use of oxytocin for the prevention of PPH? • What is the minimum effective dose of misoprostol for the prevention of PPH? • What is the minimum effective dose of misoprostol for the treatment of PPH? • What are effects and safety of misoprostol as treatment for PPH in women who received misoprostol as PPH prophylaxis? • Should misoprostol be used in addition to oxytocin for PPH prevention? • What are the effects of tranexamic acid in PPH treatment? • What are the effects of uterine massage for the prevention of PPH? • What are the effects of uterine massage to prevent PPH where oxytocin is not available? • What are the effects of uterine balloon or tamponade in the treatment of PPH? • What are the effects of uterine massage to prevent PPH where only misoprostol is available? WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 25 • What are the effects of prophylactic antibiotics after manual extraction of the placenta as part of the treatment of retained placenta? • What are the effects of the use of misoprostol for the treatment of retained placenta? • What are effects of ergometrine (in combination or not with oxytocin) after caesarean section for the prevention of PPH? • What is the optimal time for cord clamping in the context of physiologic and ac- tive management of third stage of labour? • What is the appropriate time to administer oxytocin for PPH prevention rela- tive to cord clamping and placental delivery? (i.e. before/after cord clamping  before/after placenta delivery)• Which clinical consequences of blood loss are of greatest value for the diagnosis and treatment of PPH? • What is the role of lay health workers in management of PPH? 5. Dissemination and implementation of the guidelineThe ultimate goal of this guideline is to improve the quality of care and health outcomes related to PPH. Therefore the dissemination and implementation of this guideline are crucial steps that should be undertaken by the international commu- nity and local health care services. The WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research has adopted a formal knowledge-to-action framework for the dissemi- nation adaptation and implementation of guidelines (8). In addition to this frame- work a list of priority actions was established during the WHO Technical Consulta- tion which will be used by the WHO and other partners to foster the dissemination and implementation of this guideline (EB Box 2). Guideline dissemination and evaluation The recommendations in this guideline will be disseminated through a broad net- work of international partners including WHO country and regional offices min- istries of health WHO collaborating centres other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations. A policy brief will also be developed for a wide range of policy-makers programme managers and clinicians and then disseminated through WHO country offices. Guideline implementation The successful introduction of evidence-based policies related to the prevention and management of PPH into national programmes and health care services depends on well-planned and participatory consensus-driven processes of adaptation and imple- WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 26 mentation. These processes may include the development or revision of existing national guidelines or protocols based on this document. The recommendations contained in the present guideline should be adapted into locally-appropriate documents that are able to meet the specific needs of each country and health service. Modifications to the recommendations where necessary  should be limited to weak recommendations and justifications for any changes made in an explicit and transparent manner. An enabling environment should be created for the use of these recommendations (for example by widening the availability of uterotonics) including changes in the behaviour of health care practitioners to enable the use of evidence-based practic- es. Local professional societies may play important roles in this process and an all- inclusive and participatory process should be encouraged. The WHO’s Department of Reproductive Health and Research has published specific guidance on the introduc- tion of the WHO’s reproductive health guidelines and tools in national programmes. 6. Applicability issuesAnticipated impact on the organization of care and  resources The evidence-based prevention and management of PPH can be achieved with the use of relatively inexpensive drugs. However the GDG noted that the following is- sues should be considered before the recommendations made in this current guide- line are applied:• Women should not be left alone during the first hours after delivery of the baby and the placenta • In settings where oxytocin is used attention should be paid to the oxytocin cold chain (i.e. the requirements of a temperature-controlled supply chain)• Health services adopting late cord clamping should also adopt strategies to iden- tify (and if necessary to treat) neonatal jaundice Monitoring and evaluating the guideline implementation The implementation of the recommendations in this guideline should be monitored at the health-service level.,"(76.785400390625, 446.5822448730469, 526.2852783203125, 697.9320068359375)","(29, 32)",1489
164,WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage,Interrupted time series clinical audits or criterion-based clinical audits could be used to obtain relevant data related to the management of PPH. Clearly-defined review criteria and indicators are needed and these could be associated with locally-agreed targets. The GDG strongly recommends that the cov- erage of prophylactic uterotonics be used as a process indicator for the monitoring and prevention of PPH. • Prophylactic Uterotonic Coverage Indicator: The suggested indicator is calculat- ed as the number of women receiving prophylactic uterotonics during the third stage of labour divided by all women giving birth This indicator provides an overall assessment of adherence to a key recommendation included in this guideline. The use of other locally-agreed and more specific indica-WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage 27 tors (e.g. the assessment of the use of specific uterotonics) may be necessary to obtain a more complete assessment of the quality of care related to the prevention and treatment of PPH. WHO has developed specific guidance for evaluating the qual- ity of care for severe maternal complications (including PPH) based on the near-miss and criterion-based clinical audit concepts (13). 7. Updating the guidelineThis guideline will be updated in 2017 or following the identification of new evi- dence that indicates a need to revise these recommendations. WHO welcomes sug- gestions regarding additional questions for inclusion in the updated guideline.
