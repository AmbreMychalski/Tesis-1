Its mission statement re-flects a commitment to promoting health human rights and well- being of all women especially those at the most significant risk of death and disability associated with childbearing. FIGO providesevidence- based interventions that can reduce the incidence of maternal morbidity and mortality when applied with informed consent. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) continues to be the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in most countries around the world. Despite multiple collaborative efforts at alllevels there is still a lack of implementation or adherence to the recommendations for management of PPH when faced with this obstetric emergency. In part this delay in implementationlies in the lack of information from current evidence and a lack of unification of the multiple guidelines for diagnosis and strat- egies to control bleeding.,"(67.63525390625, 598.1150512695312, 551.6649169921875, 151.7041778564453)","(3, 5)",978
3,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,To provide clear and practical toolsto approach this obstetric emergency especially for low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) the FIGO Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee (SMNH) supported by a group of experts worldwide developed this updated review. It aims toprovide multiple alternatives for the diagnosis and management of PPH tailored to the resources available at the institutional  local or regional level. This document reflects the best availableevidence drawn from scientific literature and expert opinion on the prevention and treatment of PPH in low- resource settings. FIGO believes that the greatest impediment in the adoption of a given strategy is the absence of an effective implementation tool. 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

All attempts should bemade to reduce PPH using cost- effective resource- appropriate interventions. At first all should be done to avoid PPH and re-duce the need for expensive lifesaving surgical interventions. Theroutine use of active management of the third stage of labor by all attendants regardless of where they practice should be rec- ommended.2 All birth attendants must know how to provide safe care (physiologic management) to prevent PPH in the absence of uterotonic drugs.3 2.1  |  FIGO recommendations for prevention of postpartum hemorrhage 1. The use of uterotonics for prevention of PPH during the thirdstage of labor is recommended for all births.4 5 Oxytocin (10 IU intravenously/intramuscularly [IV/IM]) is recommended for the prevention of PPH for vaginal delivery and cesarean section.4 5 In settings where oxytocin is used attention should be paid to the oxytocin cold chain.6 2. In settings where oxytocin is unavailable or its quality can-not be guaranteed the use of other injectable uterotonics (if appropriate ergometrine/methylergometrine 200 μg IM/IV  hypertensive disorders can be safely excluded prior to its use) or oral misoprostol (400–600 µg orally) or carbetocin 100 µg IM/IV is recommended for the prevention of PPH.4 5 3. The combinations of ergometrine plus oxytocin or misoprostol plusoxytocin may be more effective uterotonic drug strategies for the prevention of PPH ≥500 ml compared with the current standard  oxytocin. This comes at the expense of a higher risk of adverse ef-fects (vomiting and hypertension with ergometrine and fever with misoprostol).7 4. In settings where skilled birth attendants are not present to ad-minister injectable uterotonics and oxytocin is unavailable the administration of misoprostol (400– 600 μg orally) by community healthcare workers and lay health workers is recommended for the prevention of PPH.4 5 5. In settings where skilled birth attendants are unavailable con-trolled cord traction (CCT) is not recommended.4 6. Sustained uterine massage is not recommended as an interven-tion to prevent PPH in women who have received prophylactic oxytocin.8 7. Postpartum abdominal uterine tonus assessment for early identi-fication of uterine atony is recommended for all women.4 8. Oxytocin (IV or IM) and CCT is the recommended method for removalof the placenta for the prevention of PPH in cesarean delivery.4 2.2  |  FIGO recommendations for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage 1. Intravenous oxytocin alone is the recommended first- lineuterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH.3 4 2.,"(306.85382080078125, 90.10418701171875, 551.6409912109375, 190.7041778564453)","(5, 6)",967
4,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,If intravenous oxytocin is unavailable or if the bleedingdoes not respond to oxytocin the use of intramuscular er- gometrine oxytocin– ergometrine fixed dose or a prosta- glandin drug (including sublingual misoprostol 800 μg) is recommended.3 4 9 10 3. There is no evidence about the safety and efficacy of an additional800- μg dose of misoprostol for treatment of PPH when given to women who have already received 600 μg of prophylactic misopros- tol orally. 4. The use of isotonic crystalloids is recommended in preference tothe use of colloids for the initial intravenous fluid resuscitation of women with PPH.4 11 5. Early use of intravenous tranexamic acid as soon as PPH is diag-nosed but within 3 h of birth in addition to standard care is rec- ommended for women with clinically diagnosed PPH following vaginal birth or cesarean delivery.12– 14 6. Administration of 1 g (100 mg/ml) tranexamic acid intravenously at1 ml/min (i.e. administered over 10 min) with a second dose of 1 g in-travenously if bleeding continues after 30 min or if bleeding restarts within 24 h of completing the first dose. Reducing maternal deathsdue to bleeding through scaling up of tranexamic acid for PPH treat- ment could have a positive impact on health equity and improve out- comes among disadvantaged women especially in LMICs.15 7. Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH.3 48. The use of bimanual uterine compression or external aorticcompression for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth is recommended as a temporizing measure until ap- propriate care is available.3 4 9. If women do not respond to treatment using uterotonics orif uterotonics are unavailable the use of uterine balloon tam- ponade is recommended as an effective nonsurgical technique that can potentially improve survival in women with PPH due to uterine atony after ruling out retained products of conception or uterine rupture as a contributing factor.3 4 16 10. Use of the nonpneumatic antishock garment is recommendedas a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available.3 4 11. The use of uterine packing is not recommended for the treat-ment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth.3 4 12. Uterine artery embolization can be another conservative man-agement measure for PPH if technical conditions and skilled human resources are available for its use.17 13. If bleeding does not stop despite treatment using uterotonicsand other available conservative interventions (e.g. uterine mas-sage balloon tamponade) the use of surgical interventions is recommended.3 4 Surgical interventions include the use of com- pression suture techniques 18 uterine and hypogastric artery li- gation and hysterectomy. 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

The priority is to stop the bleeding before the patient developscoagulation problems and organ damage from under- perfusion. Conservative approaches should be tried first rapidly moving to more invasive procedures if these do not work. REFERENCES 1. World Health Organization. WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.

This document willupdate the recommendations and discuss new approaches. 3.3  |  Definition of postpartum hemorrhage The lack of consistency in the definition of PPH has been a major limitation to the ability to compare prevalence in different stud- ies (Table 2). Classically it was defined as quantified bleeding ofmore than 500 ml for vaginal deliveries and more than 1000 ml for cesarean deliveries occurring within the first 24 h of delivery.1 However this definition did not focus on clinical signs and symp- toms of hemorrhage and thus prevented early detection in many cases. Therefore in 2017 the American College of Obstetriciansand Gynecologists (ACOG) changed the definition to blood loss of more than or equal to 1000 ml or blood loss that was accompanied by signs or symptoms of hypovolemia occurring within 24 h after birth regardless of the mode of delivery.6 In contrast the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) defines PPH according to the volume of blood lost: minor (between 500 and 1000 ml) and major (>1000 ml).7 However the volume of estimated blood loss remains unreliable in many cases and therefore much attention should be directed to the general clinical status of the patient instead.8 Several tools for assessment of blood loss have been used as accurate estimation will directly influence the diag- nosis and management of PPH. Many groups cite visual estimationas part of blood loss assessment but as it has high potential to un- derestimate hemorrhage use of additional tools for more objective estimation such as gravimetric measurement direct blood collec- tion techniques and evaluation of clinical parameters have been proposed.9– 17 Recently some guidelines have incorporated the shock index9 11 14 17 and obstetric early warning systems into their recommendations to evaluate bleeding.11 14 17 3.4  |  Etiologies/risk factors While there exist several identifiable risk factors for PPH most cases occur unexpectedly.6 18 An easy way to remember the most common etiologies is to remember the four T’s19: TA B LE 1 FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage FIGO recommendation Year References Management of the third stage of labor to prevent post- partum hemorrhage 2003 International Confederation of Midwives International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians.

10,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,4  |  POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE BUNDLE CARE Multimodal strategies have been implemented in high- income coun- tries to control pathologies with high mortality rates such as PPH. These initiatives that involve multiple intervention points and actors have been called “bundles” or intervention packages which consist of the implementation of a group of interventions as well as multi- disciplinary programs that standardize and comprehensively address the management of pathologies.1– 6 Bundles represent a selection of existing guidelines and recommendations in a form that aids system- atic implementation and a consistency of practice. The California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) Working Group on obstetrical hemorrhage developed the Improving the Health Care Response to Obstetric Bleeding Toolkit in 2010 to help obstetric providers clinical staff hospitals and healthcare organizations develop methods within their facility for timely rec- ognition and an organized and rapid response to bleeding. In March2015 version 2.0 was updated with the latest evidence- based changes.6 In 2015 work groups of the National Partnership for Maternal Safety — within the Council on Patient Safety in Women's Health Care that represents all major women's healthcare professional or- ganizations in the USA — developed an obstetric hemorrhage safety bundle. The goal of the partnership was the adoption of the safetybundle by every birthing facility. This consensus bundle is organizedinto four action domains: readiness recognition and prevention re- sponse and reporting and systems learning. There are 13 key ele-ments within these four action domains (Table 3). In 2017 the World Health Organization (WHO) carried out a technical consultation among international maternal health experts to evaluate the development of care bundles for PPH. A total of 730TA B LE 3 Obstetric hemorrhage safety bundle action domains from the National Partnership for Maternal Safety Council on Patient Safety in Women's Healtha Domain Key elements Readiness (Every Unit) 1.

The consultation led toa definition of two care bundles which are summarized in Table 4. The first response PPH bundle must be implemented at both the primary healthcare and hospital levels. The discussion about the re-sponse to refractory PPH bundle raised some controversy. For thefirst response PPH bundle the next phase is the development of an implementation strategy culminating in a model for use at the facility level in LMICs. For the response to refractory PPH bundle itis a priority to solve pending controversies including the operational definition of refractory PPH and to better understand the effective- ness of various uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) devices.

12,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,5  |  SHOCK INDEX EVIDENCE IN POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT Shock refers to a reduction in tissue perfusion which is insuf- ficient to meet the metabolic requirements of tissues and organs. Insufficient blood flow may be clinically identified as the develop- ment of one or more of the following: lactic acidosis altered men- tal status oliguria and tachycardia. Vital signs monitoring is keyto hemodynamic assessment and prompt intervention.1 In healthy pregnant and postpartum women cardiologic physiologic com- pensatory mechanisms prevent changes in vital signs until a large volume of blood has been lost (usually >1000 ml). Hence changesin clinical and vital signs that result from hemorrhage appear late in the process and may not lead to early identification of PPH. This in turn makes it difficult to establish cutoff points to trigger clinical interventions. Moreover because traditional vital signschange late and are less reliable as triggers for clinical actions  other indicators could help to characterize maternal hypovolemia caused by bleeding.2 Although the use of conventional individual vital signs (pulse and systolic blood pressure) may lack accuracy in the assessment of hypotension a simple combination of both may transform routine clinical parameters into a more accurate indica- tor of hypovolemia such as the shock index (SI). SI is defined asthe ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure.3 4 The SI may im- prove the predictive capability of individual clinical signs which aids early identification of women at risk of hypovolemia as the result of obstetric causes.5 Moreover the SI has been proposed as a reliable indicator of adverse maternal outcomes 6 and its val- ues have been set to indicate clinical management.7 However the association between shock parameters and advanced treatment modalities in severe PPH has yet to be reported. 5.1  |  Assessment of circulating blood volume in postpartum hemorrhage The essential cornerstone of management of PPH involves prompt diagnosis and rapid replacement of lost blood volume as well as the oxygen- carrying capacity of blood accompanied by immediate medical and surgical measures to address the underlying cause(s)  and hence prevent more loss. To assess the patient's condition SIhas been introduced as a simple and clinically effective vital sign. The SI has been shown to have an inverse linear relation- ship with left ventricular stroke work in acute circulatory failure. Therefore a concurrent reduction of left ventricular stroke work (induced by hemorrhage trauma or sepsis) was associated with an elevation of the SI and a deterioration in left ventricular mechanical performance. Poor left ventricular function or persistent abnormalelevation of the SI after aggressive therapy and hemodynamic sta- bilization was associated with increased mortality in critically ill  traumatized patients.8 In obstetric and nonobstetric circumstances  the absence of a significant drop in blood pressure in patients with PPH may mask the actual hypovolemic status due to physiological compensatory mechanisms.9 For that reason the SI was the only promising marker that indicated the severity of blood loss.2 5 The SI together with the rule of 30 are important tools that may aid clinicians in an emergency to determine the amount of blood loss and the degree of hemodynamic instability. Before the fall in systolicblood pressure heart rate rises to compensate for the blood loss  and thus the SI increases. The rule of 30 is an approximated bloodloss of 30% of normal (70 ml/kg in adults 100 ml/kg throughout pregnancy) defined by a fall of 30% in hematocrit a fall of 30% in hemoglobin (approximately 3 g/dl) a fall of 30 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and a rise in pulse rate by 30 beats per minute.10 It has been shown that an SI ≥0.9 is associated with increased mortal- ity and an SI>1 increases the likelihood of blood transfusion.11 12 To date standard obstetric SI has been defined as 0.7– 0.9 compared with 0.5– 0.7 for the nonpregnant population taking into account that the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy may delay the recogni- tion of hypovolemia.5 If intravascular volume depletion is suspected  a rapid clinical assessment is required because the patient's clinical condition can deteriorate leading to the development of hemor- rhagic shock rapidly. Proper medical record- taking skills may high-light symptoms associated with shock such as pain and overt blood loss as well as general malaise anxiety and dyspnea. Notably in set-tings where few PPH treatment options exist and in cases of home deliveries diagnosis and treatment or referral must occur even ear- lier than in hospital settings to improve outcomes.,"(45.63779830932617, 15.533536911010742, 551.3880004882812, 610.2142944335938)","(13, 13)",998
13,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,For that reasonSI may be a valuable threshold in LMICs where mortality is highest and is often related to delays in complication recognition transpor- tation and level of care at the facility.2 A threshold of SI ≥0.9 should be tested to alert community healthcare providers of the need for urgent transfer.13 REFERENCES 1.

PPH guidelines usually address similar topics (e.g. di-agnosis prevention and treatment of PPH) but may differ in their recommendations.2– 4 These differences are because most of the recommendations are based on observational studies clinical judgment and expert opinion. There are few randomized con-trolled trials available to produce strong recommendations for the management of PPH due to the emergency of the condition that hinders this type of study. In the absence of randomized trialsguidelines gather the best available evidence. In addition popula-tion characteristics cultural aspects resources availability as well as frequency and timing of updates may influence the guidelines’ contents and justify some disparities.1– 4 REFERENCES 1.

Oxytocin has been cited as the drug of choice by most guidelines  but its dosages and route of administration vary largely especially when considering mode of delivery.1– 5 7– 10 In 2012 FIGO established recommendations for the prevention of PPH11 and in 2018 WHO updated its recommendation for pharmacological PPH prevention and reinforced the use of oxytocin (10 IU intramuscularly or intra- venously) as the drug of choice.12 WHO also recommends the use of carbetocin (if cost- effective) ergot alkaloids (alone or combined if there are no contraindications) or oral misoprostol in settings where oxytocin is not available or its quality cannot be guaranteed. Misoprostol is also recommended when the use of other injectable uterotonics is not possible due to unavailability or contraindication to use such as hypertension in the context of ergometrine.12 13 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) has updated its publication and reinforced the use of carbetocin as a first- line uterotonic for prevention at cesarean delivery or vaginal delivery with one risk factor.6 The German/Austrian/Swiss guideline mentions that prophylaxis during cesarean delivery can consist of administering either oxytocin or carbetocin.5 Other prophylactic strategies have been proposed in guidelines but many had no great consensus or no clear benefits.1– 7 Table 5 summarizes various PPH prevention strategies described by different societies worldwide.

Int J Gynecol Obstet. 2020 148:290– 299. 6.2  |  Guidelines that address the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage PPH guidelines frequently recommend a multidisciplinary approach for reaching effective early control of bleeding. Treatment should bedirected to the specific cause of PPH (uterine atony genital trauma  retained placenta and/or coagulopathy) and therapeutic steps should move from the less invasive method to the more complex and radical approach. A set of initial measures also seems to be consen-sual in most guidelines and consist of maintenance of two large IV lines supplementation of oxygen strict monitoring of women crys- talloids infusion and measures to avoid hypothermia and evaluate the PPH cause.1– 9 If atony is the etiology most guidelines suggest perform- ing temporary mechanical measures such as uterine massage or uterine bimanual compression with concurrent pharmaco- logical treatment.1– 10 Uterotonics are considered the first- line treatment for uterine atony. Intravenous oxytocin is usually thepreferred drug and route of administration but its dosage varies widely. When oxytocin fails to control PPH guidelines recom-mend the use of an additional drug such as ergot alkaloids in- jectable prostaglandins or misoprostol.1– 4 6– 8 10 SOGC mentions carbetocin as a uterotonic available for treatment 5 and the German/Austrian/Swiss guidelines highlight that the use of car- betocin to treat PPH is currently not sufficiently investigated4 (Table 6). Since publication of the World Maternal Antifibrolytic (WOMAN) trial 11 tranexamic acid (TXA) an antifibrinolytic drug has been in- corporated into PPH guidelines around the world.4 6– 10 12 13 WHO has updated this topic and recommends the use of TXA as soon as possible within the first 3 h from birth at a dose of 1 g intravenously  regardless of the route of birth.12 13 However some guidelines do not cite it5 or do not add it in a definitive manner because their last update occurred before the WOMAN trial results.1 2 Another drug that has been discussed in many guidelines is recombinant activated factor VII for massive PPH however there is no consensus about its use.1– 6 When pharmacological treatment fails in controlling hemor- rhage guidelines usually recommend some mechanical radiologi- cal and more conservative surgical approaches before performing hysterectomy. The available guidelines are summarized in Table 6. The most cited ones are uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) uterine compressive sutures (UCS) pelvic vascular ligation (PVL) and embo- lization.1– 7 10 Uterine packing with gauze is also mentioned in some guidelines but its use is controversial.3 5 ACOG mentions the use of a gauze soaked with thrombin.6 German/Austrian/Swiss guidelines cite the use of intrauter- ine packing with a gauze coated with a hemostatic agent.4 Due to the lack of evidence guidelines do not necessarily recommend these conservative approaches in a well- defined step- wise pro- gression and their utilization depends mainly on the availability of resources professional familiarity with technique and clinical circumstances.10 UBT is typically indicated as the treatment of choice when uter- ine atony is refractory to uterotonics after vaginal delivery as it is less invasive than the other procedures.1– 3 6– 9 This should be con- sidered after ruling out retained products of conception ruptured uterus or vaginal or cervical laceration as a contributing factor. IfUBT fails to control bleeding in these cases invasive treatments by arterial embolization or most commonly by surgical approaches are recommended (Table 7). UCS and/or PVL are recommended to avoidhysterectomy when laparotomy is performed. The most mentionedUCS techniques in guidelines are B- Lynch Hayman and/or Cho su- tures while the most cited PVL techniques are bilateral uterine and/ or utero- ovarian vessel ligations and less frequently hypogastric ligature.1– 10 PVL and UCS can also be used together.,"(45.60691833496094, 104.23709106445312, 367.1454772949219, 437.7042236328125)","(18, 18)",1001
19,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Embolization is also cited as a conservative therapeutic strat- egy however it is most often indicated in places where spe- cialized equipment and professionals are available in a timely manner.1– 5 7 10 Therefore these conditions may limit its use in acute bleedings. If bleeding is severe especially in low- resource settings some guidelines recommend the use of temporizing measures such as aortic compression and more recently the nonpneumatic antishock garment (NASG) to reduce blood loss until appropriate care is avail- able or while awaiting transfer to a higher- level facility.3 7 14 15 NASG has been recommended by WHO and FIGO for postpartum women with severe hemorrhage showing signs of shock or hemodynamic instability at all levels of care especially at the primary healthcare level or if transport to a higher facility is necessary.3 14 15 Regarding hysterectomy it is usually recommended when other procedures have failed to control massive bleeding or when they were not indicated. Guidelines highlight that hysterectomy shouldbe performed “sooner rather than later ” before the patient devel- ops coagulopathy.1– 7 9 10 Recently damage control surgery (intra- abdominal or pelvic packing) has been mentioned in some PPH guidelines as an approach for critically ill patients with persistent bleeding after hysterectomy.4 7 Finally many guidelines also address statements for the manage- ment of genital tract trauma (especially uterine inversion and uterine rupture) coagulopathy disorders and retained placenta in obstetric patients.

Since 1992 carbetocin has been extensivelytested in the management of PPH.1 2 Beyond its uterotonic effects  carbetocin may also promote blood coagulation.3 7.1.1  |  Clinical evidence for PPH prevention: oxytocin versus carbetocin (vaginal delivery) The Heat- Stable Carbetocin versus Oxytocin to Prevent Hemorrhage after Vaginal Birth (CHAMPION) study provided new evidence comparing oxytocin and carbetocin.4 It studied 29 645 women with cervical dilation <6 cm having a singleton pregnancy and planned for vaginal delivery. Patients were rand-omized to receive intramuscular injection of 100 µg heat- stable carbetocin (Paban) or 10 IU oxytocin in 10 different countries. The data showed that for PPH prevention heat- stable carbetocin was not inferior to oxytocin administration for blood loss of at least 500 ml (RR 1.01 95% CI 0.95– 1.06) or the use of additional uterotonic agents. Noninferiority was not shown for the outcomeof blood loss of at least 1000 ml (RR 1.04 95% CI 0.87– 1.25). Inthis study when the two drugs were compared the following re- sults were obtained: in women with >500 ml blood loss additional uterotonic agents were required in almost 15% of cases in both arms. When blood loss exceeded 1000 ml the requirement foradditional uterotonics was only 1.5% in both arms.3 Therefore ac- cess to drugs is key since oxytocin has problems with drug purity in low- resource settings. The safety profile appeared to be similarfor both drugs.,"(306.8495788574219, 398.1352233886719, 290.4583435058594, 619.7041625976562)","(24, 25)",926
26,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,More recently a network meta- analysis including 140 random- ized trials with data from 88 947 women was developed to identify the most effective uterotonic drug(s) to prevent PPH and generate a ranking according to their effectiveness and adverse effect pro- file.5 The data showed that compared with oxytocin the combina- tion of ergometrine plus oxytocin had a risk ratio of 0.69 (95% CI  0.57– 0.83) and was more effective however with only moderate quality evidence and with higher risk of adverse effects such as vomiting and hypertension. For carbetocin the risk ratio was 0.72(95% CI 0.52– 1.00) and although it was significant there was very low- quality evidence. Finally for misoprostol plus oxytocin the riskratio was 0.73 (95% CI 0.60– 0.90) with moderate quality evidence and higher risk of fever.5 In a low- risk setting there may be advan- tages to using well- tested and readily available drugs. When thecarbetocin effect was compared with the use of rectal misoprostol for preventing PPH in low- risk patient populations in a random- ized controlled trial among 150 pregnant women the data showed the superiority of carbetocin for efficacy.6 This was evidenced in all indices tested beyond blood loss patients had a shorter third stage of labor and reduced need for additional uterotonic drugs. Additionally adverse effects such as diarrhea shivering and fever were more pronounced with misoprostol administration.6 In a ran- domized controlled trial of patients with severe pre- eclampsia car- betocin was shown to be a good alternative to oxytocin requiring a lower volume per dose.7 7.1.2  |  Clinical evidence for PPH prevention: oxytocin versus carbetocin (cesarean delivery) Cesarean delivery is a surgical procedure requiring high skill oper- ating time anesthesia intravenous fluids and different drugs. Theaddition of carbetocin therefore is expected to be of benefit and the need for a single drug administration reduces the need for an intensive management team which is generally required following a cesarean delivery. A Cochrane review including 11 studies showedthat despite a statistically significant reduction in the need for fur- ther uterotonics in the carbetocin group compared with oxytocin in women undergoing a cesarean delivery no statistically significant differences in terms of the risk of PPH were noted.8 In 2018 a meta- analysis to analyze the effectiveness of carbetocin compared with oxytocin for the prevention of PPH in cesarean deliveries (seven studies involving 2012 patients) demonstrated a significant reduc- tion in the rates of PPH (RR 0.79 95% CI 0.66– 0.94 P = 0.009) use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.57 95% CI 0.49– 0.65 P < 0.001)  and transfusion (RR 0.31 95% CI 0.15– 0.64 P = 0.002) when carbe- tocin was used instead of oxytocin. However despite the potentialbenefits the disparity between the cost of carbetocin and oxytocin suggests that a locoregional cost- effectiveness analysis should be performed before making the decision to adopt carbetocin for rou- tine prophylaxis.9 In 2020 sequential trial analysis of five randomized controlled trials of studies with data on women (a total of 1214) undergoing nonelective cesarean deliveries where carbetocin was compared with oxytocin was performed.10 The need for additional uteroton- ics was reduced with carbetocin compared with oxytocin (OR 0.30  95% CI 0.11– 0.86 I2 90.60%). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) con-firmed that the information size needed to show a significant re- duction in the need for additional uterotonics had been exceeded. No significant differences were shown with respect to any of the secondary outcomes but there was significant heterogeneity be- tween the studies. The authors concluded that further trials utiliz-ing consistent core outcomes are needed to determine an effect on PPH.10 On the other hand a single center study was carried out to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of carbetocin compared with oxy- tocin when used for prophylaxis against PPH.,"(45.6364860534668, 493.1042175292969, 585.5413818359375, 766.5151977539062)","(25, 25)",980

Their cost- saving per PPH case was USD$ 278.70.11 Anotherstudy where 1500 cesarean deliveries (both elective and emer- gency) were analyzed over 12 months carbetocin use as opposed to oxytocin use reduced 30 (88 vs 58) PPH events (>500 ml blood loss) and saved £27 518. Carbetocin had a 91.5% better outcomeand was 69.4% cheaper.12 When compared with the need for ad- ditional uterotonics in the carbetocin group none required addi- tional medication versus 71.5% in the oxytocin group (P < 0.01). In another prospective cohort study carbetocin used for 400 patients undergoing cesarean delivery led to reduced PPH and the use of other oxytocic agents saving £68.93 per patient.13 In 2019 a systematic review of the cost- effectiveness of uterotonic agents for the prevention of PPH was published with 15 studies across all income categories that compared misoprostol versus no uterotonic (five studies) or versus oxytocin (one study) carbeto- cin versus oxytocin (eight studies) and one study comparing nu- merous uterotonics.14 The evidence on the cost- effectiveness of various uterotonic agents was not generalizable to different con- texts. In the absence of reliable evidence the choice of uterotonicwill likely be highly influenced by uterotonic price and contextual factors. In the context of cesarean delivery carbetocin was morecost favorable than oxytocin. The authors concluded the qualityof the evidence provided by these studies has a lack of sensitivity analyzes and incomplete description of the methods of outcome and costs measurements in most studies. In addition some studiesfrom middle- income countries favoring carbetocin were funded by the manufacturer. They interpreted findings from these studiesand those of the conference abstracts with limited data cautiously  owing to the potential risk of bias and imprecision. Therefore itcan be easily inferred that the relative cost- effectiveness of car- betocin is still inconclusive. Beyond its primary efficacy which is reduced blood loss a drug's safety profile must also be considered before wide- scale utilization. The adverse effects of carbetocin and oxytocin wereexamined in a small randomized study.15 The data showed that car- betocin had a lower rate of nausea. In contrast with other clinicalindices including the need to stabilize systolic blood pressure and heart rate no other differences were noted.15 Since anesthesiolo- gists administer carbetocin for cesarean delivery the requirement for increased dose beyond the standard 100 ug in some instances was raised.16 The longer half- life of carbetocin prevents additional dosing in case of a persistent bleed and does not permit additional oxytocin administration. The increase in carbetocin dose from100 µg to 140 µg injection increases cardiovascular complications.17 Thus in cases of pre- eclampsia close attention is warranted for preserving patient safety before high dose carbetocin is adminis- tered. Also in those cases oxytocin doses must be increased tocontrol bleeding beyond the standard treatment mainly if the drug was used during labor which may also increase complications rate. A case report showed that carbetocin administration for a patient with asthma led to nearly fatal bronchospasm and cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation which was successful.18 Therefore this drug should be used with caution in patients with asthma or those with advanced pulmonary pathology. This and other studies showinconsistency in adverse events data and indicate that the utility of carbetocin should be further assessed in additional pregnancy pathologies to establish the population in which the risk– benefit profile is favorable.

An antifibrinolyticdrug is useful because hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion are common in the early stages of major postpartum bleeding and although existing medical and surgical interventions can be used to treat postpartum bleeding TXA offers an alternative way to sup- port hemostasis. 8.1  |  Administration of TXA 1. Administration of TXA is recommended as soon as the di-agnosis of PPH is made if the diagnosis is made within 3 h of delivery. When more than 3 h has elapsed since deliverythere is no clear evidence of benefit from TXA administration. TXA for PPH treatment is given 1 g IV over 10 min within 3 h of vaginal or cesarean delivery. One gram (10 ml of a100 mg/ml solution) is infused over 10– 20 min because infu- sion >1 ml/min can cause hypotension. If bleeding continuesafter 30 min or stops and restarts within 24 h after the first dose a second dose of 1 g may be given. The antifibrinolyticeffect lasts up to 7– 8 h in the serum. The concentration inbreast milk is approximately one hundredth of the serum peak concentration so it is unlikely to have antifibrinolytic effects in the infant.2 3 The WOMAN trial found that administration of TXA within 3 h of delivery to women with established PPH decreases maternal mortality secondary to bleeding and reduces the need for laparotomy to control hemorrhage.2 2. TXA as a management strategy in addition to uterotonics re-duced the risk of PPH in randomized trials. Its use is effectivein high- risk clinical settings (e.g. delivery of patients who refuseblood products patients with a significant risk for PPH such as placenta accreta or placenta previa or previous PPH).,"(45.63779830932617, 44.63540267944336, 290.4565734863281, 684.7041625976562)","(27, 28)",944
30,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Usually1 g TXA intravenously is recommended within 10 min after vag- inal delivery in addition to oxytocin cord traction and uterine massage.4 5 A Cochrane review of antifibrinolytic agents used for the treatment for PPH identified three eligible trials two of which compared intravenous TXA with placebo or standard care (the WOMAN trial and a French trial).4 6 A meta- analysis of 20 172 women from the WOMAN trial and the French trial (152 women with PPH received high- dose TXA a loading dose of 4 g over 1 h followed by an infusion of 1 g over 6 h) showed that TXA reduces the risk of death due to bleeding (RR 0.81  95% CI 0.65– 1.00) with early treatment being more effective. WHO updated its recommendation on the early use of TXA for the treatment of PPH (within 3 h of birth) with intravenous TXA using the same dosing regimen as in the WOMAN trial: a fixed dose of 1 g in 10 ml (100 mg/ml) intravenously at a rate of 1 ml/ min. A second 1 g intravenous dose should be administered ifbleeding continues after 30 min or restarts within 24 h of the first dose. 3. TXA should be given to all women with clinically estimated bloodloss of more than 500 ml after vaginal birth or 1000 ml after ce- sarean delivery or any blood loss that is sufficient to compromise hemodynamic stability regardless of the cause of hemorrhage. TXA forms a reversible complex that displaces plasminogen from fibrin resulting in inhibition of fibrinolysis and inhibition of the proteolytic activity of plasmin. TXA is recommended for PPHmanagement. It is given concomitantly with other drugs and pro-cedures for control of bleeding. An antifibrinolytic drug is usefulbecause hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion are common in the early stages of major postpartum bleeding. Delay in treat-ment even if short reduces the benefit of TXA administration. The WOMAN trial found that TXA reduced death due to bleeding in women with PPH by 20%– 30% and was not associated with an increase in adverse effects. It also reduced the incidence oflaparotomy to control bleeding by 36% but did not reduce hys- terectomy rates. However the decision to perform hysterectomywas sometimes made at the same time as randomization so some hysterectomies were performed before or concurrently with ad- ministration of TXA.2 3 8.2  |  TXA as a prophylactic measure Although the WOMAN trial presents evidence for the use of TXA to treat established PPH there is limited evidence for its role in prevention of PPH. Reviews and meta- analyses of multi-ple trials have shown that prophylactic use of TXA may decrease both postpartum bleeding and the need for blood transfusions.7 8 However larger adequately powered multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed before the prophylactic use of TXA can be recommended for the prevention of PPH. In 2021 a mul-ticenter double- blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 4551 women undergoing cesarean delivery before or during labor at 34 or more gestational weeks who received an intrave- nously administered prophylactic uterotonic agent and either TXA (1 g) or placebo. Among women who underwent cesarean deliveryand received prophylactic uterotonic agents TXA treatment re- sulted in a significantly lower incidence of calculated estimated blood loss greater than 1000 ml or red- cell transfusion by day 2 compared with placebo but it did not result in a lower incidence of hemorrhage- related secondary clinical outcomes.9 Several sys- tematic reviews related to the treatment of PPH exist. Mousaet al.10 conducted a review that sought to include studies examin- ing the effectiveness of all types of treatments for PPH. Howevertheir review primarily included studies involving treatment with misoprostol and little evidence regarding TXA. They concludedthat more research was needed regarding the effectiveness of TXA for treatment of PPH.10 Additionally the existing systematic reviews that examined TXA for prophylaxis against PPH (where 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].,"(57.60939025878906, 532.104248046875, 549.6380004882812, 33.70758819580078)","(28, 29)",991

TXA should always be readily available in obstetric care fa-cilities. It is cost- effective heat stable and widely availablewith a long shelf life. An economic evaluation that used datafrom the WOMAN trial to assess the cost- effectiveness of early TXA for usual care of women with PPH in Nigeria and Pakistan concluded that it is likely to be highly cost- effective.4 2. TXA should be used in addition to all usual treatments for themanagement of PPH including medical (uterotonics) nonsurgical  and surgical interventions.2 3 3. It has a wide therapeutic index and a further intravenous in-jection could be given when this becomes possible. Alternativeroutes of administration should be a research priority as recom- mended by WHO.12 4. Owing to improvements in emergency obstetric care includinguse of TXA as a first- line therapy more women will survive PPH than ever before. Furthermore the incidence of PPH is increas-ing 1 and consequently the number of women who will experience its physical and psychological consequences will also increase. More research is needed on how to reduce the risk factors for PPH. REFERENCES 1. Ker K Edwards P Perel P Shakur H Roberts I.

Direct abdominal and pelvic compressionreduces the total vascular space in the lower body and decreases pelvic perfusion to pelvic compartment organs and smaller pelvic blood vessels promoting hemorrhage arrest.6 Additionally the pres- sure applied increases cardiac output and the central circulation al- lowing an increased distribution of blood flow to vital upper body organs (heart lung brains) and contributing to a rapid recovery from shock.1 7 Likewise the direct compression of the descending aorta re- duces bleeding from the uterine arteries and the mesenteric bed's vasculature perhaps decreasing up to 90% of blood flow at the level of the superior mesenteric artery.1 8 A further property of the NASG that makes it useful for maternal hemorrhage is the easy access to the vagina and perineum thereby facilitating genital medical and surgical interventions.,"(306.8655090332031, 439.5929260253906, 183.43495178222656, 515.7042236328125)","(29, 30)",951
33,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Additionallyit is extremely cost- effective even for very low- resource settings  and is reusable as it can be disinfected and washed over 100 times without losing its compressive effects.3 It is also adjustable for many women of different girths and heights. 9.1.1  |  Safety According to human studies the NASG is a safe device with no ad- verse effects such as abdominal wall lesions or other types of po- tential injuries secondary to the circumferential pressure applied  independent of the patient's body mass index or the strength used to close each of the segments of the garment.2 In multiple studies  there were no adverse events associated with NASG use: no in- creased rates of dyspnea cardiac or renal dysfunctions. In fact inall studies of NASG involving extremely ill women with severe PPH  there were decreased rates of all severe maternal morbidities.4 Doppler studies of the distal aorta when the NASG is applied have shown a drop in the flow rate (volume/time) up to 33%. Additionally when the garment's abdominal and pelvic segments are placed the resistive index (inversely proportional to flow rate) of the internal iliac arteries increases.7 9.1.2  |  Effectiveness and advantages Multiple studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy and ef- fectiveness of the NASG. Observational quasi- experimental studiesat referral centers in Egypt Nigeria India Zambia and Zimbabwe showed a 48% drop in maternal mortality related to hypovolemic shock (secondary to PPH).2 Overall the groups that received NASG treatment required fewer transfers to higher complexity facilities as well as abdominal hysterectomies (for definitive therapeutic ap- proach) than women in the control groups with a relative risk of 0.44 (95% CI 0.23– 0.86).9 A randomized controlled trial implemented in Zambia and Zimbabwe demonstrated that early placement of the NASG at pri- mary healthcare centers was associated with a statistically signifi- cant decline in shock recovery time (defined as shock index <0.9)  with a median time to recovery of 170 min for the NASG group ver- sus 209 min for the control group with a hazard ratio of 1.2 (95% CI  1.02– 1.52 P = 0.03). Although the reduction in mortality and severematernal morbidities (54%) in this study was not statistically signif- icant (perhaps due to much smaller sample size than was necessary to show statistical significance) it is still significant considering the seriousness of the outcomes.10 In 2015 a systematic review of quasi- experimental studies and the trial above compared PPH standard care versus standard care plus NASG. It found that the use of the NASG combined with stan-dard PPH care reduces both maternal mortality (48%) with a relative risk of 0.52 (95% CI 0.36– 0.77) and a 68% reduction in combined adverse outcomes mortality and severe morbidities (RR 0.31 95% CI 0.17– 0.59). Furthermore safety was demonstrated by the ab-sence of differences in adverse events among groups.2 Effectiveness outside of clinical trials has been reported in one large implementation project in Tanzania that was conducted in 280 healthcare facilities in four rural regions with over 1700 women with PPH 24.5% (n = 419) of whom had severe PPH and hypovolemic shock.11 Of these women 70.8% received the NASG which indicated high utilization and high acceptability. There was also a temporal as-sociation of a 67% reduced risk of mortality among women with se- vere PPH during the project (RR 0.33 95% CI 0.16– 0.60). Use of the NASG is recommended for the clinical stabilization and safe transfer to high complexity centers in the clinical scenario of PPH.,"(45.609100341796875, 454.1042175292969, 585.5413818359375, 766.5151977539062)","(30, 30)",844
34,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,This device is currently used in over 50 countries world-wide and it has been recommended in many national and interna- tional guidelines such as GLOWM WHO FIGO and others.12– 15 This device should be present in every healthcare facility as it has proven to be effective and safe granting significant reductions in PPH- related mortality.3 15 16 Besides the acceptability demonstrated in the Tanzania study qualitative research in a few settings has re- ported high acceptability from women and providers.11 17– 19 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

It is important to note that the gar-ment serves as a temporizing measure. Thus once hemodynamicstability is restored patients should receive definitive medical and surgical treatment. Table 8 provides a reference for the indicationsfor NASG application.3 9.1.4  |  Instructions for use The NASG is composed of six articulated segments. The first threesegments are bilateral and independent segments for the lower body parts: ankles calves and thighs. The other three circumferen-tial segments are placed over the pelvic and abdominal areas. It mustfirst be unfolded entirely and placed under the patient's body. Toassure proper application of the garment placement of the superior edge of segment 6 (the superior segment) over the lower rib should be confirmed. The device can be adjusted to all sizes and heights. Forinstance in shorter patients segment 1 can be folded into segment 2 to keep the first applied segment at the ankle and it can be per- formed whenever someone who is competent to insert it is available. For garment applications each segment must be stretched and closed as tightly as possible starting at the ankles with segment 1 and continuing with the remaining segments successively.5 It is im- portant to try to keep both knees uncovered by the leg segments to preserve joint mobility. The leg segments of the NASG can be placedby one or two people depending on the availability of healthcare personnel. Appliers can use the pubic symphysis as an anatomicalreference point for placing segment 4. Appliers can use the umbili-cus as guidance for placing segments 5 and 6. Although all segmentsshould be closed firmly and tightly the abdominal section must not be closed too tightly in order to maintain adequate respiration. Forthat reason it is advised that only one person should close segments 5 and 6. If there is more than one person available two people cancoordinate their actions with one person presenting the opposite segment to the person who will close both segments together. If thepatient shows signs of respiratory distress abdominal segments (5 and 6) can be loosened but not completely opened. If the patient requires surgical intervention the leg sections should remain closed while the pelvic and abdominal segments can be tem- porarily opened just before the skin incision is made and then closed once the procedure is concluded. In addition a drop in blood pres-sure should be expected when the abdominal and pelvic segments are opened and hence appropriate measures should be taken. 9.1.5  |  Monitoring and removal Patients using the NASG should be closely followed with continuous monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure and optimal fluid resus- citation.5 This device can be used safely for up to 48 h as a tempo- rizing measure until hemodynamic stability or adequate hemorrhage control is achieved. Nevertheless there are reports of the NASGused for longer than 72 h. To safely remove the NASG healthcareprofessionals must verify the following criteria: blood loss <50 ml/h  heart rate <100 bpm and systolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg (rule of 100’s) for at least 2 h.5 Once the following criteria are corrobo- rated it is safe to start removing the garment. The intravenous lineshould remain in situ during the removal. Removal should follow thesame steps as application starting with segment 1 at the ankles and moving slowly up to segment 6.,"(306.8341064453125, 623.1041870117188, 549.6262817382812, 593.7042236328125)","(30, 31)",979
35,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Every time a segment is opened a15- min period is allowed to re- evaluate vital signs and check for ac- tive bleeding. If vital signs remain stable and there are no signs of ac-tive bleeding it is safe to open the next segment. However if systolicblood pressure drops ≥20 mm Hg or heart rate increases ≥20 bpm (rule of 20’s) or active bleeding is identified all of the segments must be rapidly closed again. Once removed the NASG should be placed ina biohazard container and sent to be laundered dried and refolded. Videos and presentation slides of correct application use removal  and cleaning can be obtained for free at: www.safem other hood. ucsf.edu.

If bleeding does not stop after its insertion then it isbetter to review the etiology of PPH. Placement of a UBT deviceshould be considered early when emergency measures for man- agement of PPH are initiated.

If the uterus fails tocontract ergometrine or misoprostol should be administered bi- manual uterine or aortic compression should be initiated a UBT placed and the NASG applied (response to refractory PPH bun- dle).2 These two sets of approaches have recently been defined as the “PPH bundle”.3 Observational studies have reported UBT success rates between 83% and 95% overall with nearly 100% survival among women with uncontrolled hemorrhage when a UBT device was placed before the onset of advanced shock.4– 6 The integration of UBT into PPH clinical pathways in high- income countries has been shown to avert hyster- ectomy and significantly reduce the need for PPH- related invasive procedures such as artery ligation uterine compression sutures and arterial embolization.7– 10 A 2020 systematic review and meta- analysis showed an overall pooled success rate of 85.9% (95% CI 83.9– 87.9%) for the treatment of PPH with higher pooled success rates corresponding to PPH due to uterine atony and placenta previa and lower pooled success rates for PPH due to placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) and retained prod- ucts of conception.11 A safety trial in Kenya and Sierra Leone on a uniquely designed condom uterine tamponade device (ESM- UBT) demonstrated no increased risk of infections or perineal injuries and success rates of condom UBT devices appear to be comparable to those of Bakri balloons.12 Available UBT devices and specific consid- erations are described below. 9.2.1  |  Available UBT devices Uterine balloon devices can be divided into two groups: 1. Fixed volume devices: condom uterine balloons (ESM- UBT kitCG balloon) Bakri balloon Rusch balloon and Ebb system.12– 16 2. Free flow devices: the glove balloon Ellavi UBT and Zukovskiballoon.17– 19 The glove and Ellavi balloons allow intrauterine pres- sure control according to systolic blood pressure. The Zukovskiballoon uses 50 cm (3.8 cmHg) pressure for inflating the balloon. 9.2.2  |  Tamponade effect The mechanism of action of UBT devices is likely multifactorial. Twoproposed mechanisms include device stimulation of receptors which in turn stimulates uterine contraction as well as the direct application of hydrostatic pressure against the bleeding sinuses.,"(306.8568115234375, 481.1354064941406, 290.4723205566406, 723.7041625976562)","(32, 33)",958
38,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,It has been proposedthat if uterine wall pressure exerted by a UBT equals the systolic arte- rial pressure of the bleeding sinuses a tamponade effect is created.14 However Georgiou20 measured intraluminal pressures in Bakri bal- loons in two cases where UBTs had been placed and discovered that tamponade occurred at UBT device pressures lower than systolic blood pressures. Further research is needed to better understand the precisebiomechanical relationship between a UBT device and a bleeding uterus. 9.2.3  |  Free flow tamponade device Blood is supplied to the uterus via maternal arterial blood that passes through the myometrium through low resistance sinuses.21 Following delivery of the placenta the muscle fibers of the myome- trium contract and retract closing off the sinuses and limiting blood loss. While the immediate aim in PPH due to atonic uterus is to arrestblood loss the ultimate goal is to employ best practice interventions to facilitate contraction of the myometrium. The surgical glove bal-loon the Ellavi UBT and the Zukovsky balloon are free flow systems that allow water to be expelled from the balloon to theoretically better allow for the natural physiological process of contraction and retraction of the myometrium once the uterus has recovered.17– 19 However almost all commercially available UBT devices are low- pressure high- volume systems that allow for easy UBT expulsion when the uterus regains its tone and begins to contract. 9.2.4  |  Drainage port The need for a drainage port with a UBT device is questionable.13 14 16 Drainage ports are only a few millimeters in diameter and there- fore are easily obstructed by clotted blood. Furthermore since thesource of bleeding in atonic uterus is from the site of placental im- plantation which encompasses only about 20% of the uterine cavity  a drainage port is less likely to be in proximity to the bleeding site. 9.2.5  |  Correct placement Multiple techniques have been described on the best approach to place a UBT device. The approach should in part be determined bythe device being used (e.g. stiffness of the introducing end and num-ber of balloons). To ensure that the balloon could engage within thearea that is actively bleeding all UBTs should be inserted through the cervix and positioned to sit in the upper uterine segment. Oneapproach includes placing the hand into the uterus and ensuring that the fingertips reach the thick anterior and posterior layers of the upper segment. The UBT is then fed into the upper segment of theuterus with the free hand. When withdrawing the uterine hand thetubing is held with the free hand. While the balloon is filled two fin-gers are held in the vagina below the cervix to prevent inadvertent balloon expulsion. 9.2.6  |  Assessment of effect Multiple studies have shown that women with uncontrolled PPH from an atonic uterus will almost universally survive if a UBT device is placed in a timely fashion. If UBTs are placed before patients pro-gress to advanced shock success rates approach 100%.6 However  studies such as by Dumont et al.22 and Natarajan et al.23 have shown that improvised UBTs delays in recognition of PPH and lack of 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

While different UBT systems may fill to their desired statesat different rates it is even more important to recognize that impro- vised and untested UBTs are less often used. Moreover wheneverthey are their use is often delayed they are more difficult to place  fall out more easily and are associated with overall lower success rates.12– 14 17 19 Therefore immediate recognition of PPH and emer- gency action with a quality UBT device is imperative to save lives. 9.2.7  |  Transfer Many studies report high rates of hemorrhage control after UBT insertion thus rendering transfers unnecessary. Most often incor-rect diagnosis and misplacement are the cause of UBT failure.,"(45.63779830932617, 636.1041870117188, 288.41339111328125, 281.7041931152344)","(33, 34)",987
39,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Ifbleeding recurs or the patient continues to be unstable after UBT insertion then consideration of transfer to higher levels of care should be made. Transfer can occur with both fixed- volume bal-loons and closed- off free- flow balloons but all UBTs must be care- fully secured to prevent accidental displacement. A transfer planshould be in place in all obstetric settings regardless of whether it will be needed or not. This is an absolute necessity in PPH bundles. 9.2.8  |  UBT after cesarean delivery Use of UBTs for hemorrhage control after cesarean delivery is a commonly performed technique worldwide but there is scant sup- porting literature. There are a few reports on successful outcomeswith use of UBT in placenta previa. It appears that UBT has highersuccess rates in women with PPH after vaginal delivery than after cesarean delivery.11 18 24– 26 9.2.9  |  Combining UBT with compression sutures Placing a UBT after application of uterine compression sutures requires control of the amount of pressure exerted in the uterus to prevent uterine necrosis. Although uterine necrosis is possiblefollowing the insertion of compression sutures alone the risk un- derstandably would increase with pressure exerted from inside the uterus when UBT is used additionally. Cases with uterine necro-sis following insertion of compression sutures have been reported with and without UBT.27 28 The surgical glove balloon and the Ellavi UBT are UBT devices that allow the intrauterine pressure to be controlled by adjusting the height of the intravenous fluid bag or supply bag above the patient.17 18 With systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg and the supply bag or intravenous infusion fluid 1.3 m above the patient the pressure exerted by the balloon will be 100 mm Hg. The specific gravity of mercury is 13 times more thanwater. The device used for the balloon must be large enough to beinflated with fluid without requiring any expansion pressure. This isachieved by using a surgical glove and the Ellavi UBT.17 18 9.2.10  |  Other uses of UBT While the use of UBT for uncontrolled PPH is fairly well estab- lished published case reports and senior leaders in obstetrics and gynecology have described successful use of UBTs in other cir- cumstances such as in molar pregnancy- associated hemorrhage  placenta accreta retained placenta and in cases of intentional vaginal and cervical placement to temporize uncontrolled bleed- ing from lacerations.29 WHO recently published recommendations regarding use of UBT in the context of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth in women who do not respond to standard first- line treatment.30 According to WHO among the prerequisites for use of UBT evi- dence supports the need for access to surgical intervention and blood products as well as the availability of health personnel skilled in its use. They recognize that conditions may not be operationalizedacross all clinical settings and that observational studies suggest a substantial reduction in the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality following uterine balloon tamponade and that further research is needed in low- resource settings.

However unlike the medical and surgi-cal treatments for PPH no randomized controlled trials regarding its effectiveness have been conducted.,"(45.667755126953125, 359.6354064941406, 551.70556640625, 346.7041320800781)","(35, 35)",997
42,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,The decision to perform uterineartery embolization in patients with persistent uterine bleeding should be made in consultation with an interventional radiologist. Althoughembolization may be considered as the technique of choice for manag- ing PPH by some authors certain practical issues must be considered.1 Uterine artery embolization has been shown to be effective in the treatment of various causes of PPH including placenta accreta: Both UAE and uterine artery ligation have reported success rates of greater than 90% with low complication rates. If both techniques areavailable embolization is the preferred first choice as it obviates lap- arotomy. Ligation can be attempted subsequently if embolization isunsuccessful. In contrast after an unsuccessful uterine artery ligationembolization may be extremely difficult or even impossible leaving hysterectomy as the only remaining option. Some cases may requirehysterectomy because of failure of embolization. UAE has shown to beeffective in controlling secondary bleeding and the placenta was found to gradually decrease in size in all patients. UAE plays an important rolein managing these patients because it is effective at reducing uteropla- cental blood flow to further induce thrombosis of the intervillous space and to achieve necrosis of the retained placental tissue.2– 7 Selective UAE is effective in the control of PPH thus avoiding hysterectomy. Availability of resources to perform the procedure: A radiologist trained in embolization techniques is a prerequisite as is the appro- priate equipment for vascular intervention. Digital road- mappingmay be required and the possible complexity means that this proce- dure can only be performed in a fully equipped X- ray department.8 The interventional radiologist inserts sheaths into both femoral ar- teries to deploy a deflated occlusion balloon into each of the internal iliac arteries.9 The sheaths are removed and the deflated balloons remain in place until after delivery. After the patient has undergonea cesarean delivery the interventional radiologist will inflate the balloons if needed based on the amount of bleeding.

Ojala et al.13 and Badawy14 described a series of cases in patients who underwent embolization of the uterine arteries. Catheterizationaverted hysterectomy in close to 80% of cases. 9.3.1  |  Complications Some studies have documented resumption of menses and even pregnancies after the procedure.15 Complications of pelvic embo- lization for PPH occur at a rate of 8.7%. The most common com-plication is low- grade fever. Less common complications are pelvicinfection groin hematoma iliac artery perforation transient buttock ischemia transient foot ischemia and bladder gangrene. Lee et al.16listed dissection of the uterine arteries hematoma at the puncture site paresthesia and lower limb edema as complications. Currently most PPH cases requiring hysterectomy are related to placenta previa.17 . These patients are commonly diagnosed beforedelivery and are usually delivered by elective cesarean delivery. Thisplanning may allow increased use of invasive radiological services in the management of such cases by inserting the intra- arterial bal- loons before going to surgery. 9.3.2  |  Implementation of treatment 1.

Uponlaparotomy bleeding at the surgical site should be minimized by ad- equate packing to minimize time lost for suturing while active bleed- ing is ongoing. In all cases the uterus should be fully exteriorized ifpossible. Blood loss should be minimized while fully extending theuterus causing vasoconstriction and a tourniquet placed around the low segment until surgical compression sutures are successfully ap- plied.1 This enables the surgical team to use the following described methods by applying the uterine compression sutures with a high degree of safety. In addition injections of vasopressin at a doseof 4 U in 20 ml of saline in the placental bed after removal of the placenta may lead to reduced blood loss as well.2 Placement of en- douterine square hemostatic sutures may also be used to control bleeding from the placental bed.3 Hemostatic suturing technique as a second- line strategy for con- trol of uterine bleeding due to uterine atony is an effortless fast and conservative surgical procedure. It can be performed satisfactorilyafter a cesarean delivery or after a vaginal delivery.4 Complications related to its application have been identified but there are no re- ports of deaths related to compression sutures. Complications caninclude uterine synechia or ischemia uterine necrosis 5 intrauterine infection 6 and strangulation of the intestinal loop and abdominal omentum when nonabsorbable stitches are used 7 but nonabsorb- able sutures can be used if other types of sutures are not available. While most births are uncomplicated obstetricians are often faced with PPH at the time of vaginal or cesarean delivery.8 9 If ini- tial management with fundal massage manual uterine compression  or uterotonics (oxytocin misoprostol methergine or carboprost tromethamine) does not adequately reduce bleeding placement of compression sutures can be done to slow bleeding and stabilize the patient avoid hysterectomy and ultimately reduce maternal mor- bidity or death. The three most used compression suture techniquesfor PPH are B- Lynch 10 Hayman 11 and Pereira.12 Other compression sutures are cited in the literature such as Cho Ouahba Hackethal  and Massuba.8 If a Bakri balloon is available the obstetrician can combine any of these three compression sutures with the placement of the balloon to tamponade bleeding. In some instances expedientplacement of an O’Leary stitch for temporary devascularization of the uterine arteries can decrease bleeding and allow additional time for placement of the compression sutures. As with the conduct ofcesarean delivery specific practical issues have to be considered. First the obstetrician should be well versed in sterile pelvic vascular operative techniques as placement of sutures will occur at the time of cesarean delivery or with laparotomy following vaginal delivery and PPH.,"(306.8512268066406, 537.09765625, 551.6787719726562, 60.70418167114258)","(36, 37)",1001
45,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,Second since time is critical to reducing maternal bloodloss an operative team with the technical skills for additional an- esthesia administration of blood products and surgical assistance is crucial to the success of surgical management. Three commonlyused compression sutures are described below and existing data are summarized on the effectiveness of each compression technique. 10.1.1  |  Commonly used compression sutures for managing PPH The B- Lynch suture was first introduced in 1997 by Christopher Lynch to address hemorrhage with open hysterotomy at the time of cesarean delivery.10 A suture is placed on the right side of the hysterotomy entering at the base of the incision and exiting at the top.13 The suture is then carried across the top of the right fundus and a posterior stitch is placed with the entrance of the suture at the same level of the anterior suture and exiting on the left posterior side of the uterus at the level of the uterine incision. Suture is thenlooped over the left fundus and another stitch is placed at the top of the left side of the uterine incision and exiting at the base of the incision. The suture is then tugged tightly compressing the body ofthe uterus with placement of a surgeon's knot. Following placementof the B- Lynch suture the transverse hysterotomy is closed in the usual fashion. In the original description of B- Lynch a chromic su-ture was used. Subsequent case studies have reported successfuluse of a monocryl suture. Additional options for compression sutures include the Hayman and Pereira. In 2002 the Hayman suture was designed tobe a technically easier alternative to the B- Lynch suture that could be placed expediently and not require hysterotomy. The steps forplacing a Hayman suture include two to four longitudinal (on the left and right side of the uterus) sutures that pass directly from the anterior uterine wall and through the posterior uterine wall and are tied using a surgeon's knot at the fundus. A transversecervicoisthmic suture traversing the anterior and posterior uterine walls can be placed to address bleeding from the lower uterine segment. The Pereira compression technique includes five sutures com- bining two longitudinal sutures with three transverse sutures. Theadvantage of the Pereira sutures is that placement occurs in the submucosal region and avoids the endometrial cavity. However at-tention is needed for correct placement of the transverse sutures to prevent damage to the uterine vessels and ureters. Based on the available literature the success rate of compres- sion sutures in achieving hemostasis is 76%– 100%.14 To date no randomized controlled trials or controlled studies have compared the efficacy of the different compression sutures. In the three orig-inal studies for B- Lynch Hayman and Pereira success rates were reported as 100% (5/5 for B- Lynch 3/3 for Hayman and 7/7 for Pereira). In a systematic review 14 the overall success rate of com-pression sutures was reported as 91.7%. Given the broad use ofcompression sutures and the impact on maternal morbidity and mortality it is unlikely that a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of different compression techniques will be conducted.

Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020 (7):CD013663. 10.3  |  Bilateral internal iliac artery ligation Internal iliac artery ligation was first performed by Kelly in 1894 1 with reported success rates between 40% and 100%.2 3 It reduces pelvic blood flow by half and pulse pressure by 85% thereby simu- lating a venous rather than an arterial circulation and promoting hemostasis.1 2 Although this technique provides a rapid and effec- tive way to control hemorrhage it remains underused because of understandable fear of injury to surrounding structures: internal and external iliac arteries and ureters2 4 and should only be considered if experienced pelvic surgeons are available. Internal iliac artery liga-tion may avoid the need for hysterectomy in the context of uterine atony.2 In addition in cases of traumatic PPH such as uterine rupture and extensive genital injuries internal artery ligation clears the op- erative field and facilitates hysterectomy.2 During the procedure the common iliac artery is identified. After dissection the ureter is visualized crossing the common iliac artery at its bifurcation. The common iliac artery branches into aninternal iliac (hypogastric) artery coursing medially and inferiorly  and the external iliac artery coursing laterally and superiorly. Thearteries are not infrequently adherent to the underlying veins and require appropriate dissection.5 With right- angled forceps a su- ture is introduced between the artery and the vein and a knot is made.4 5 Noteworthy is that even after bilateral internal iliac artery li- gation the vascular supply to the pelvis is not completely compro- mised due to the extensive collateral circulation that exists.4 5 The revascularization is provided by the deep femoral artery the anas- tomosis between the medial femoral circumflex and obturator ar- tery and that between the lateral femoral circumflex and superior gluteal artery and the ovarian artery.4 5 Obstetricians ought to be more familiar with this procedure as it is an effective and rapid way to control PPH.

This is achievedby a staged surgical approach that minimizes operative time  counteracting life- threatening conditions and deferring the de- finitive surgical procedures until normal physiology is restored at the intensive care unit (ICU).5– 7 Efforts in DCR are focused on permissive resuscitation by blood product transfusion use of massive blood transfusion protocols limited use of crystalloids bleeding control (including damage control surgery [DCS] and damage control interventional radiology [DCIR]) and physiological and biochemical stabilization in the ICU.4– 6 DCR is usually reserved for severely injured patients who may not survive the surgical efforts to achieve primary re- pair in the operating room.4 It is evident that this approach can be considered only in higher- level care facilities where there is avail- ability of experienced personnel with 24- h laboratory and blood bank services. The most important aspects of DCS are described below. Hypotensive and hemostatic reanimation are discussed in sections 11.2.1 and 11.2.6 respectively. 11.1.1  |  Decision for damage control surgery Physiological and metabolic markers have been proposed to identify patients that could benefit from DCS.4 Three parameters have been described in the literature as significant clinical indica- tors for early implementation of DCR and DCS8: acidosis (base deficit >8) blood loss >1500 ml and hypothermia (temperature <35°C). Other important parameters to consider are systolicblood pressure <70 mm Hg maternal blood pH <7.1 and persis- tent bleeding despite several transfusions (defined as 6 units of packed red blood cells by some authors7 and >10 units by oth- ers4) (Table 9). Continuous vital sign monitoring and serial monitoring with blood gas analysis and body temperature are recommended. Operativetime and number of blood units transfused are also crucial for DCR decision- making.4 11.1.2  |  Bleeding control After identifying eligible DCS patients when medical and surgical conservative measures to control bleeding fail a sequential four- phase approach should be performed.4 Initial laparotomy The primary objective is hemorrhage control which is achieved by an abdominal hysterectomy. The type of hysterectomy tobe performed depends on the preference and expertise of the operator and the clinical condition of the patient other factors such as age cause of hemorrhage hemodynamic stability and pelvic anatomy must be considered.9 According to several stud- ies there are no statistically significant differences between total and subtotal hysterectomy in terms of complications blood transfusions and ICU admission.9– 11 Subtotal hysterectomy has been associated with quicker hemorrhage control and shorter operative times hence is the preferred approach over total hysterectomy.9 11 The bleeding site must be identified to pick the most suitable approach.,"(306.83447265625, 118.13540649414062, 551.6622314453125, 658.7041625976562)","(40, 41)",983
51,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,When the bleeding is in the lower uterine segmentcervix or vaginal fornices a subtotal hysterectomy may not be the most effective approach for hemorrhage control since the ar- terial circulation of the cervix has a high blood flow rate and could cause bleeding persistence. In these cases total hysterectomy ispreferred.9 10 Operative time is a crucial determinant in patient survival. Prolonged operative time has been linked to adverse outcomes as it can institute an irreversible physiologic insult thus the need to keep operative time under 90 min.4 TA B LE 9 Alternative indications for damage control surgery secondary to postpartum hemorrhagea Indication Systolic blood pressure <70 mm Hg Body temperature <34ºC Maternal blood pH <7.1 Venous bleeding not suitable for surgical control Persistent bleeding despite several transfusions of blood products (>10 units of PRBC) Massive transfusion: 6 units of Red Blood Cells (during the first 4 h) Increasing and continuous need for fluids due to active nonarterial bleeding Hemodynamic instability requiring persistent vasopressor support or that results in the development of ventricular arrhythmias Coagulopathy resulting from a combination of hypothermia (temperature <35°C) acidosis (pH <7.3) and loss of coagulation factors Duration of surgery >90 min aSource: Carvajal et al.

As in other surgical specialties packing is the cornerstone of obstetric DCS.4 7 Pelvic packing should be performed with at least 7– 10 compresses according to reported experience.2 12 Aside from pelvic packing temporary abdominal closure is performed along- side as a complementary feature of the procedure. The latter canbe achieved using a negative pressure system like vacuum pack or partial closure with a Viaflex bag (Bogota Bag) without the need for negative pressure.2 12 Currently there is neither consensus nor sufficient evidence regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing DCS with abdominal packing.4 Several surgi- cal guidelines recommend the administration of a single preopera- tive dose of broad- spectrum antibiotics which theoretically should provide sufficient coverage for aerobic and anaerobic microorgan- isms.4 13 14 Other experts suggest administration of prophylactic broad- spectrum antibiotics every 6– 8 h until the abdominal packing is removed. Nevertheless further studies are necessary to provideevidence- based recommendations in the obstetric population.7 Resuscitation – ICU At this stage the patient must be transferred to the ICU to address the physiologic derangements of the hemorrhagic patient: coagula- tion disorders and metabolic abnormalities.6 Interdisciplinary care involving the obstetrician and critical care specialist is key for these patients as complications could arise at any time.4 It is crucial to ac- curately quantify the accumulation of blood in the abdominal cavity. The optimal device to do so after partial abdominal closure is the vacuum pack which allows a more precise quantification of bleeding during the postoperative period. In patients without coagulopathythe drainage of >400 ml/h of blood through the vacuum pack repre- sents an early indication for laparotomy.4 Definitive surgery After restoring normal physiology it is considered safe to review the abdominal cavity. Ideally this should be performed 48– 72 h after theinitial surgical procedure.4 Patients may require one or more surgical interventions depending on the operative findings. In cases wherefurther interventions are warranted it is recommended to continue with techniques of temporary closure of the abdominal cavity.15 Definitive closure of abdominal wall and cavity The final stage is the definitive closure of the abdominal wall which is performed after all surgeries have been successfully completed and all additional damage has been repaired.4 11.1.3  |  Complications The majority of DCS complications depend on the time of closure of the abdominal fascia.,"(306.85009765625, 597.1041870117188, 551.6869506835938, 86.70418548583984)","(41, 42)",941
52,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,It is important to consider that the numberof reinterventions is directly related to a higher percentage of infec- tious complications wound dehiscence and abdominal wall closure problems.16 The main complications include infection of the surgical wound in 28% of cases presence of intra- abdominal collections in 20% and evisceration in 10% of patients.2 Implementation of pro- phylactic antibiotic therapy could counteract these complications as it targets the polybacterial flora present in the female genital tract. An interdisciplinary approach could be required in case of complica- tions derived from injuries secondary to the surgical procedure such as urinomas perforations or fistulas among others.17 11.1.4  |  Final objectives in resuscitation DCR should be maintained as long as there are signs of bleeding and coagulopathy. A continuous assessment of the hemodynamic andphysiological status of the patient is required. Monitoring severalresuscitation parameters is essential until tissue hypoxia reverts. These parameters include pH base deficit lactate hematocrit and coagulation— ideally evaluated with conventional laboratory tests and point- of- care testing (POCT) of viscoelastic coagulation such as thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). In patients with a clinical trend toward improvement thedecision to perform definitive surgery is appropriate.4 REFERENCES 1. Pacheco LD Saade GR Gei AF Hankins GD.

There are two strategies for fluid resuscitation in patients with hemorrhage: the aggressive approach and the hypotensive resusci- tation approach. Aggressive resuscitation refers to the traditionallyused strategy in which the key principle is restoring the effective circulating blood volume and rapid normalizing of blood pressure with administration of large amounts of crystalloids.2 4 Hypotensive resuscitation also called permissive hypotension consists of restric- tive crystalloid resuscitation during the early stages of a hemorrhagic shock to maintain lower than normal systolic or mean blood pressure  sustaining organ perfusion until control of the bleeding occurs.2 5 In contrast hemostatic reanimation is based on early and ag- gressive blood product replacement transfusing red blood cells (PRBC) fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets (PLT) in the same proportion as found in circulating blood to correct coagulopathy.6– 8 Hypotensive resuscitation and hemostatic reanimation are the fun- damentals for DCR.9 10 11.2.1  |  Hypotensive resuscitation The concept of hypotensive resuscitation is because administering small crystalloid volumes reduces the risk of dilutional coagulopathy and maintaining a lower blood pressure is less likely to disintegrate the pre- formed blood clots. Aggressive resuscitation may worsen coagu-lopathy and hemorrhage by increasing intravascular hydrostatic pres- sures diluting coagulation factors and inducing more hypothermia  which results in deterioration of the triad of death.4 10 11 Furthermore  an excessive rise in blood pressure could also result in higher red blood cell loss leading to more hypoxia and acidosis in tissues.4 11 11.2.2  |  Intravenous fluids Among the initial strategies for reanimation the administration of crystalloids in small boluses of 500 ml is recommended.10 Scientific evidence recommends the use of balanced crystalloid solutions such as Ringer's lactate owing to the risk of hyperchloremic acidosis and the worsening of kidney function with chlorine- rich fluids (saline so- lution).7 This is particularly important for LMICs where saline- based solutions are in abundance.,"(45.642791748046875, 72.63540649414062, 549.637939453125, 632.7041625976562)","(43, 43)",941
54,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,After the administration of each bolusphysicians must assess the clinical status of patients looking for an im- provement in signs and symptoms of shock resulting from blood loss.10 11.2.3  |  Targeted blood pressure The difference between aggressive and hypotensive resuscitation lies within targeted blood pressure management.4 Mean arterial pressure (MAP) represents the perfusion of the majority of organs  therefore providing the target for clinicians to guide fluid adminis- tration.11 Hemorrhagic shock animal models have demonstrated a positive benefit in survival with MAP between 55– 60 mm Hg dur- ing active bleeding.10 The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma recommends permissive hypotension with a systolic blood pressure target of 80– 90 mm Hg (MAP 50– 60 mm Hg) until major bleeding has been con- trolled (Recommendation Grade 1C).12 11.2.4  |  Aggressive approach and adverse outcomes During hemorrhagic shock the endothelial glycocalyx becomes thin- ner and administration of large amounts of crystalloids exacerbates this state leading to fluid extravasation that may cause cerebral  cardiac and pulmonary edema.7 10 11 Third spacing may also lead to cardiac dysfunction worsen hemodynamics and decrease kidney perfusion. Decreased kidney perfusion occurs because of an in-crease in intra- abdominal pressure which can additionally result in abdominal compartment syndrome.7 11 11.2.5  |  Evidence Several studies in trauma patients have demonstrated that hy- potensive resuscitation is correlated with benefits to survival  18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

The use of FFP PLT and cryo-precipitate was delayed until coagulopathy was demonstrated in paraclinics.7 Hemostatic resuscitation limits the use of crystal- loids and involves early administration of blood products (not only PRBC) making massive transfusion protocols the cornerstone of resuscitation.7 10 11.2.7  |  Transfusion ratios In hemostatic resuscitation PRBC FFP and PLT are applied in a 1:1:1 ratio due to the resemblance with whole blood and because a “high ratio” is related to fewer complications and better patient survival outcomes.6 7 10 15 If PRBC is not available then whole blood can be used instead in case of massive hemorrhage. The strongest evidence for massive transfusions comes from the Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMTT) and Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) trials.,"(306.84991455078125, 272.10418701171875, 549.639892578125, 73.70418548583984)","(43, 44)",845
55,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,The PROMTT study evidenced an improve-ment in mortality in the first 6 h for patients with high ratios of trans- fusion (<1:2 vs ≥1:1).16 Moreover a secondary analysis from PROMTT revealed that early administration of plasma (first 3 h and within the first 3– 6 transfused units) was related to a decrease in mortality at 24 h and 30 days.17 However the PROPPR study demonstrated that patients transfused with a 1:1:1 ratio achieved hemostasis and suf- fered fewer deaths due to exsanguination at 24 h.18 11.2.8  |  Fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate In hemorrhages fibrinogen is the first clotting factor to diminish its concentrations to critical levels with values of <200 mg/dl consid- ered an indication for component replacement.7 10 Achieving specific fibrinogen levels is an important target during massive transfusion (at least 150– 200 mg/dl in PPH).7 Sources for fibrinogen replacement are FFP cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrates (which are not widely available). Because fi-brinogen concentration in FFP is variable and relatively low and its administration may dilute the existent fibrinogen most fibrinogen replacement is done with cryoprecipitate.12 A unit of cryoprecipitate contains 2 g fibrinogen for each 100 ml thus a unit of cryoprecipi- tate will increase serum fibrinogen by 10 mg/dl.7 The usual dose of cryoprecipitate is 10 units which is estimated to raise serum fibrino- gen by 100 mg/dl.7 Subsequent doses must be adjusted conforming to serum fibrinogen levels. 11.2.9  |  Massive transfusion protocols As the underlying physiological imbalance and clinical course in trauma seem similar to severe PPH massive transfusion pro- tocols with high ratios utilized for trauma may be useful for PPH.19 20 Recommendations for ratios 1:1– 1:2 for transfusions are different from previously proposed protocols with ratios of 6:4:1 or 4:4:1 as in the CMQCC Obstetric Hemorrhage Toolkit and from other obstetrics societies.21 ACOG recommends admin- istration of blood products in 1:1:1 ratio mimicking whole blood replacement.22 Massive transfusion means requirements of ≥4 PRBC units (some articles considered ≥10 PRBC within 24 h) replacement of total blood volume within 24 h or replacement of 50% of blood volume within 3 h.10 The protocol for massive transfusion is spe- cific at each institution but some schemes have been suggested in the literature. Once the massive transfusion protocol has been activated the blood bank will send blood products in rounds to the operating or labor room. Each round has a specific number of PRBC FFP PLTand cryoprecipitate units according to the protocol established in the institution. Typical rounds consist of 6 units PRBC 6 units FFP 6 units PLT or 1 platelet apheresis and 10 units of cryoprecipitate (Table 10).7 23 24 Unless inactivated the blood bank will prepare and send the prod- ucts for rounds 2– 4 successively and if the patient continues bleed- ing the protocol will start again from round 1.7 It is very important to notify the blood bank as soon as the transfusion requirements decrease to stop the preparation of blood products.7 TA B LE 10 Massive transfusion protocol in obstetricsa PRBCs FFP Platelets Cryoprecipitate Round 1 6 U 6 U 6 U 10 U Round 2 6 U 6 U 6 U 10 U Round 3 Tranexamic acid 1 g intravenously over 10 min Round 4 6 U 6 U 6 U aSource: Pacheco et al.

Care bundles have been associated with improved patientoutcomes when adherence is high. The goal of the PPH bun-dle is to reduce the frequency of severe hemorrhage and improve maternal outcomes. There is still a need for good-quality research to determine whether the bundle approach will ultimately make a difference in saving women's lives from PPH. 2. In recent years new scientific evidence and the availability ofnew technologies have driven important reflections about PPH. To guarantee quality of guidelines it is important to update the evidence and base recommendations on the best quality stud- ies available. It is also essential to stimulate production of newresearch on the key themes of PPH to reduce disparities among guidelines. PPH guidelines have helped improve the care ofwomen around the world and their use should be stimulated in all scenarios. 3. The shock index indicator defined as the ratio of heart rate tosystolic blood pressure is simple to use.,"(306.84771728515625, 207.13717651367188, 192.94381713867188, 346.7041931152344)","(45, 46)",984
58,FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022,It has better predictiveability than other vital signs because it detects acute changes in the maternal cardiovascular system and appears as an early marker to predict adverse outcomes. 4. Evidence continues to support oxytocin as the first- line drug inthe prevention of PPH in all births. 5. Women with PPH should receive a fixed dose of 1 g tranexamicacid in 10 ml (100 mg/ml) intravenously (1 ml/min) as soon as possible after delivery and no more than 3 h after birth. A sec-ond dose of 1 g should be given intravenously if bleeding con- tinues after 30 min or restarts within 24 h of the first dose. Tranexamic acid should be given in addition to usual treatments for the management of PPH including medical (uterotonics)  nonsurgical and surgical interventions regardless of the cause of hemorrhage or the mode of delivery. 6. The nonpneumatic antishock garment (NASG) is an effectivenonsurgical device that should be in every healthcare facility. The NASG when used as a temporizing measure to recover hemodynamic stability in the context of PPH decreases mor- bidity mortality and hypovolemic shock and is of special impor- tance in LMICs. While considerable research is still necessary toimprove knowledge on implementation issues professional as- sociations and national and international guidelines should con- tinue to encourage NASG use for refractory PPH management. 7. Uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) is an effective nonsurgicaltechnique that when employed rapidly by a properly trained person with a proven device in the context of quality PPH care (the PPH bundle) improves survival of women with refractory PPH. National and international guidelines should include UBTuse in the management of PPH. 8. Interventional radiology may be indicated for the preventionand treatment of PPH either before delivery in cases of known placental abnormalities and implantation or after delivery when the patient is hemorrhaging. Prophylactic catheterization of theuterine arteries with embolization can be considered an impor- tant therapeutic strategy that is safe and effective for reducing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality by controlling blood loss. 9. Regardless of the compression suture chosen obstetriciansmust first quickly recognize the onset of PPH safely admin- ister uterotonics and place emergent compression sutures if needed. In the immediate postoperative period womenshould be monitored for complications such as hematometra  pyometra and uterine synechiae. Most important is the abilityof the obstetrician to control bleeding using medical and sur- gical interventions stabilize the mother and reduce maternal morbidity. 10. PPH is a serious life- threatening obstetric emergency and earlyrecognition of this condition results in better outcomes. In caseswhere medical treatment fails to control the bleeding several surgical options exist. To date no randomized controlled trialshave assessed these techniques nor compared the superiority of one to another and all the data are based on case reports and case series. Moreover the use of these methods largely dependson the facilities provided in each institution and on the care pro- viders’ skills and familiarity with the procedures. Hence an ef-fort should be exercised for better training of all care providers in these life- saving techniques. Future fertility rate following theseprocedures remains underassessed due to the lack of long- term follow- up for these cases. In the future more research shouldtarget these surgical techniques to shy away from the more morbid procedures thereby improving maternal and perinatal outcomes. 11. Damage control resuscitation (DCS) is a combination of resuscita-tion and surgical interventions with the purpose of restoring he- mostasis and normal physiology. These techniques have proven tobe applicable in obstetrics with satisfactory results controlling re- fractory PPH and an overall decreased mortality of critically ill pa- tients especially in patients in whom conventional treatment can be linked to a high risk of failure. DCS is an available therapeuticapproach for the management of severe PPH thus proper training must be widespread to implement this technique. 12. Basic recommendations for resuscitation in PPH include admin-istration of crystalloids in small boluses of 500 ml checking clini- cal signs and looking for its improvement and use of balanced crystalloid solutions such as Ringer's lactate which is preferred over chlorine- rich solutions. The target blood pressure in hypo-tensive resuscitation is 80– 90 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure or 50– 60 mm Hg for mean blood pressure. 13.,"(62.609405517578125, 298.10418701171875, 551.7112426757812, 671.7041625976562)","(46, 46)",995
