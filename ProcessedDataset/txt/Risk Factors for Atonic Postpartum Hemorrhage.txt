Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To identify and quantify risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed  CINAHL  EMBASE  Web of Science  and and ClinicalTrials.gov 
databases were searched for English language studies with no restrictions on date or location. 
Studies included randomized trials  prospective or retrospective cohort studies  and case–control 
studies of pregnant patients who developed atonic postpartum hemorrhage and reported at least 
one risk factor.
METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Title  abstract  and full-text screening were performed 
using the Raayan web application. Of 1 239 records screened  27 studies were included in this 
review. Adjusted or unadjusted odds ratios (ORs)  relative risks  or rate ratios were recorded or 
calculated. For each risk factor  a qualitative synthesis of low and moderate risk of bias studies 
classifies the risk factor as definite  likely  unclear  or not a risk factor. For risk factors with 
sufficiently homogeneous definitions and reference ranges  a quantitative meta-analysis of low and 
moderate risk of bias studies was implemented to estimate a combined OR.
TABULATION  INTEGRATION  AND RESULTS: Forty-seven potential risk factors for atonic 
postpartum hemorrhage were identified in this review  of which 15 were judged definite or likely 
risk factors. The remaining 32 assessed risk factors showed no association with atonic postpartum 
hemorrhage or had conflicting or unclear evidence.
CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of postpartum hemorrhage occurs in the absence of 
recognized risk factors. Many risk factors for atonic hemorrhage included in current risk-
assessment tools were confirmed  with the greatest risk conferred by prior postpartum hemorrhage 
of any etiology  placenta previa  placental abruption  uterine rupture  and multiple gestation. Novel 
risk factors not currently included in risk-assessment tools included hypertension  diabetes  and 
ethnicity. Obesity and magnesium were not associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this 
review.

###2###SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO  CRD42020157521.
Postpartum hemorrhage affects 3–10% of deliveries and accounts for nearly 20% of 
maternal deaths worldwide.1 2 Although there are many etiologies  uterine atony is the most 
common and accounts for nearly 70% of cases.3 Patients who experience postpartum 
hemorrhage can have increased morbidity and mortality  which can be attenuated by 
identifying patients at risk  early preparation  and increased vigilance.1 4 Risk stratification 
for postpartum hemorrhage is commonly performed using an assessment tool from one of 
several organizations  such as the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative  
Association of Women’s Health  Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses  or the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists.5–7 Although these risk-assessment tools have the support 
of major medical societies  recent evidence suggests that the tools have only moderate 
predictive value for severe hemorrhage in the highest risk groups and that a significant 
portion of hemorrhages (up to 43%) occur in those deemed low risk.8 9 This limitation may 
be partly due to the tools’ development via expert consensus opinion and a lack of 
systematically reviewed evidence to support or refute the included risk factors. A recently 
published meta-analysis that evaluated the association between maternal demographics and 
comorbidities  and postpartum hemorrhage evaluated only four potential risk factors and 
found body mass index  nulliparity  and hypertensive disorders to confer risk of postpartum 
hemorrhage.11 Additionally  existing tools assess the risk of all postpartum hemorrhage 
etiologies simultaneously  which may confound attempts at risk prediction because each 
etiology of postpartum hemorrhage is likely associated with different risk factors. 
Furthermore  current tools fail to account for the relative contribution of each risk factor or 
to provide mechanisms to quantify risk for a given patient when more than one risk factor is 
present. Because each etiology of postpartum hemorrhage likely has a unique set of risk 
factors  evaluating each etiology separately may improve the ability to delineate individual 
patient risk. The systematic identification and quantification of risk factors for atonic 
postpartum hemorrhage may allow the development of more reliable  weighted risk-
stratification tools. Thus  this systematic review aimed to identify risk factors that increase 
the odds of a patient developing postpartum hemorrhage due only to uterine atony after 
vaginal or cesarean delivery.

STUDY SELECTION
Eligibility for inclusion was limited to randomized clinical trials  prospective or 
retrospective cohort studies  and case–control studies written in the English language with 
pregnant patients who developed postpartum uterine atony or atonic postpartum hemorrhage. 
Definitions of atonic postpartum hemorrhage varied by study and included some 
combination of clinical diagnoses  second-line uterotonic administration  estimated blood 
loss  need for transfusion  or International Classification of Diseases codes (Table 1). Studies 
were excluded if they reported postpartum hemorrhage data without specifying etiology or if 
they did not report the incidence of at least one risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage in a 
uterine atony subgroup. Case reports  case series  and unpublished meeting abstracts were 
excluded. Two blinded authors screened abstracts  and a third blinded author resolved 
conflicts. Full-text articles were obtained for all included abstracts. Full-text article review 
was conducted by the same two blinded authors  with conflicts resolved in the same manner. 
Title  abstract  and full-text screening were performed using the Raayan web application.12
The risk of bias for each included study was assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment 
Tool for Nonrandomized Studies.13 This tool was chosen because of the nonrandomized 
nature of all included studies as well as its scope in assessing multiple sources of bias  
including those related to selection  performance  detection  attrition  and reporting. Six 
domains of risk of bias were assessed  including: 1) selection of participants  2) confounding 
variables  3) measurement of exposure  4) blinding of outcome assessments  5) incomplete 
outcome data  and 6) selective outcome reporting. Bias scoring proceeded after training each 
scorer on the assessment tool to ensure good inter-rater reliability correlation. Two authors 
(D.H.C.  H.B.E.) independently assessed the risk of bias for each study  with disagreements 
resolved by a third blinded author (J.R.B.). Studies were found to have a low risk of bias if 
they attained a low-risk classification in all six evaluated domains. Studies were considered a 
moderate risk of bias if at least one domain was rated unclear risk (but no domains were 
rated high risk). Finally  studies were found to have a high risk of bias if at least one domain 
was rated high risk.
All data were collected independently by co-investigators into a study spreadsheet and 
verified by a separate author. In addition to baseline study characteristics including country 
of origin  study design  the number of patients  and inclusion and exclusion criteria  data 
were collected on all risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage reported in the study. 
For each risk factor  adjusted or unadjusted odds ratios (aOR  uOR)  relative risks (aRR  
uRR)  or rate ratios (arr  urr) were recorded when available. If not explicitly reported  uOR 
and 95% CI were calculated with a 2×2 table using the number of patients with and without 
a given risk factor who developed atonic postpartum hemorrhage.14 The primary outcome 
assessed in all studies was the OR  RR  or rr of risk factors associated with atonic 
postpartum hemorrhage. For each identified risk factor  low and moderate risk of bias studies 
were synthesized qualitatively to label each risk factor as definite  likely  unclear  or not a 
risk factor based on the number of total studies evaluating the factor and percentage of Ende et al. Page 3

homogeneous definitions and reference ranges  a quantitative meta-analysis of low and 
moderate risk of bias studies was implemented to estimate a combined OR. The inverse 
variance random effects method was used for meta-analysis.15 This method requires only 
effect estimates (ie  OR or risk ratios) and their SEs. The SEs were estimated by 
backtransforming the 95% confidence limits using the standard normal distribution. The 
DerSimonian-Laird estimator was used to estimate the between-study variance in effects.16 
Owing to the rarity of uterine atony (and  thus  the near-equivalence of the OR and RR)  
studies that reported a risk ratio were included. Adjusted and unadjusted risk ratios and ORs 
were included. The I2 statistic and a P-value against the null hypothesis (ie  I250) are 
reported for each subgroup. The I2 statistic represents the percentage of variability in the 
effect estimates that is attributable to study heterogeneity (compared with sampling 
heterogeneity). Meta-analysis was implemented in R 3.6.3 (https://www.r-pro ject.org)   using 
the “metafor” 2.4 add-on package.
RESULTS
The database search revealed 1 977 total records  and 1 239 records were screened after 
removing duplicates. After excluding 871 records based on title and abstract review  368 
full-text articles were assessed for eligibility (Fig. 1). Twenty-seven studies reported data for 
at least one risk factor for atonic postpartum hemorrhage and were included in the narrative 
summary. Of those  19 studies contributed data to the qualitative synthesis and 13 to the 
meta-analysis. Table 1 summarizes the study design  patient population  study definitions of 
postpartum hemorrhage and uterine atony  and the risk factors assessed in the included 
studies. The scoring for risk of bias for each study is reported in Figure 2.
A total of 47 unique risk factors were identified in the search: 15 relating to maternal history 
or demographics  11 to maternal comorbidities  six pregnancy-related factors  eight labor-
related factors  and seven delivery-related factors. For qualitative comparison  the authors 
characterized each risk factor as definite  likely  unclear  or not a risk factor based on the 
number of low and moderate risk of bias studies that showed statistically significant 
evidence that the risk factor was associated with atony (Box 1).
Six variables were found to be definite risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage  based 
on either all low and moderate risk of bias studies showing a positive association (if at least 
three studies) or the majority of low and moderate risk of bias studies showing a positive 
association (if at least five studies). Definite risk factors included being of Asian race  a 
history of prior postpartum hemorrhage of any etiology in a previous pregnancy  preexisting 
or gestational diabetes mellitus  placental disorders (including retained placenta  placenta 
previa  vasa previa  and placental abruption  but excluding abnormal placentation)  
prolonged labor (as defined in each study and presented in Appendix 2  available online at 
http://links.lww.com/AOG/C163 )  and genital tract trauma sustained during delivery. An 
additional nine variables were deemed likely associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage  
and these included being of Hispanic ethnicity  nulliparity  hypertensive diseases of 
pregnancy  multiple gestation  chorioamnionitis  uterine rupture  predelivery oxytocin 
exposure  induction of labor  and instrumented vaginal delivery. Some variables that are Ende et al. Page 4

associated specifically with atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this review but may confer risk 
for hemorrhage due to other etiologies. These included maternal obesity  leiomyomas  
polyhydramnios  prolonged second stage of labor  magnesium exposure  and cesarean 
delivery. Meta-analysis was implemented for 24 risk factors with at least two low or 
moderate risk of bias studies demonstrating homogeneous risk factor definitions and

DISCUSSION
This systematic review highlights several previously unrecognized risk factors for atonic 
postpartum hemorrhage that are not included in current risk-assessment tools  and it 
questions whether other risk factors used in current tools are  in fact  supported by published 
evidence. This review also provides further evidence supporting the validity of many risk 
factors already included in risk-stratification tools and provides quantitative estimates of 
their contribution to atonic postpartum hemorrhage risk. Although some risk factors 
presented may cause postpartum hemorrhage independently  for example genital tract 
trauma or abnormal placentation  these factors also appear to contribute to uterine atony  
and  thus  are captured in this review.
Perhaps most importantly  current risk-assessment tools fail to include some definite or 
likely risk factors that appear to be well-established in the literature. Hispanic ethnicity (OR 
1.23  95% CI 1.20–1.25) and Asian race (OR 1.39  95% 1.33–1.46) were associated with 
atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this review and are missing from current risk-assessment 
tools. The ORs for ethnicity and race are comparable with those for commonly cited risk 
factors  including induction of labor (OR 1.23  95% 1.10–1.39) and macrosomia (OR 1.46  
95% 1.35–1.57). Given the mounting evidence of disparities in the care of minority women  
we may be failing to anticipate the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage in these 
populations.17 These associations do not imply causation  and it is unclear whether the 
underlying mechanism of these relationships are biological  social  or a byproduct of 
disparities or systematic racism.18 Specific attention must be paid when including race or 
ethnicity in risk-prediction systems  because recent evidence suggests that these algorithms 
may perpetuate health care disparities.19 20
Hypertensive disease (OR 1.84  95% 1.45–2.33) and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.22  95% 1.08–
1.39)  both of which are known to be associated with vascular and perfusion abnormalities  
also emerged as previously underappreciated risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage.
21–23 We hypothesize that the vascular pathophysiology of these diseases may contribute Ende et al. Page 5

atony and hypertension or diabetes in specific patient populations may also explain this 
association and certainly warrants further investigation.24 25 Interestingly  high vaginal 
lacerations and cervical trauma are not included in current risk-assessment tools. However  
high vaginal and cervical lacerations demonstrated higher OR than either instrumented 
delivery or perineal trauma  both of which are included in the Association of Women’s 
Health  Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses’ risk-stratification tool.6 Although nulliparity and 
prolonged first stage of labor were found to be associated with atonic postpartum 
hemorrhage and are not included in the current risk-assessment tools  they may be associated 
with other risk factors that are included  such as induction of labor  oxytocin use  and 
chorioamnionitis. Of these factors  chorioamnionitis demonstrated the highest OR of 1.93 
(95% CI 1.56–2.39) and may contribute significantly to an increased risk associated with 
nulliparity or prolonged first stage of labor. Finally  uterine rupture was found to be 
associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Although not specifically described in the 
studies that reported this association  hemorrhage attributable to uterine atony presumably 
occurred after repair of the uterine defect.
Additionally  some risk factors currently included in risk-assessment tools are not supported 
by this literature review of atonic postpartum hemorrhage  although an association with 
other etiologies of postpartum hemorrhage would not be captured by this study. Prolonged 
second stage of labor (which is included in nearly all risk-assessment tools) did not emerge 
as a definite risk factor for atonic postpartum hemorrhage in our systematic review and 
meta-analysis  with combined OR 1.10 (95% CI 0.82–1.48). Polyhydramnios did not emerge 
as a risk factor for atonic postpartum hemorrhage in quantitative analysis  with combined 
OR 1.29 (95% CI 0.94–1.76)  despite the historical identification of polyhydramnios as a 
cause of atonic postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine overdistention. Macrosomia and 
multiple gestation  which are implicated by a similar mechanism  did demonstrate increased 
risk with combined OR of 1.46 (95% CI 1.35–1.57) and 2.16 (95% CI 1.53–3.06)  
respectively. Uterine overdistention alone  however  may not fully explain the variability in 
the risk of atony that is observed between these three conditions. For example  multiple 
gestation pregnancies are frequently due to in vitro fertilization  which has been associated 
with increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage possibly due to abnormalities of placental 
implantation and endometrial function.26 Additionally  there may be some underlying 
immunologic  vascular  or genetic pathophysiology that overlaps with infertility and atonic 
postpartum hemorrhage.27–30
Obesity and magnesium exposure are additional factors included in most risk-assessment 
tools; however  neither showed associations with atonic postpartum hemorrhage in this 
review. It is possible that the underlying conditions (ie  diabetes mellitus  hypertension) are 
the real risk factors  as discussed above  leaving the clinical impression that obesity and 
magnesium increase postpartum hemorrhage risk and leading some studies to find a positive 
effect. Given the retrospective nature of most included studies  however  magnesium 
exposure and dosing may have been inadequately captured  hindering the ability to 
demonstrate an association with atonic postpartum hemorrhage.Ende et al. Page 6

###7###Cesarean delivery and uterine leiomyomas are included in the risk-assessment tools but were 
not found to be associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage by either qualitative or 
quantitative analysis. Because intrapartum cesarean delivery is associated with factors (eg  
prolonged labor and oxytocin exposure) shown to increase the risk of atonic postpartum 
hemorrhage  this may contribute to a positive association in studies or a clinical impression 
that cesarean delivery is significantly associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. The 
occurrence of leiomyomas varies significantly in size  location  vascularity  and previous 
surgical interventions  which may influence the ability to determine the significance of 
leiomyomas as a risk factor in published studies.
Finally  many risk factors already included in widely adopted risk-assessment tools are 
further confirmed in this systematic review as associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage
—prior postpartum hemorrhage  multiple gestation  placental disorders (previa or 
abruption)  chorioamnionitis  predelivery oxytocin exposure  induction of labor  prolonged 
labor  perineal trauma  and instrumented vaginal delivery. Although some of these factors 
(eg  abnormal placentation  birth canal trauma) are etiologies for postpartum hemorrhage 
themselves  the evidence presented here suggests that they are additionally associated with 
the development of uterine atony. This evidence further supports the inclusion of these 
factors when stratifying risk  and our data may help health care professionals improve tools 
by assigning a quantitative weight to risk factors with a stronger association with atonic 
postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally  current tools likely can be further improved by more 
nuanced definitions of some factors shown to have a robust association with atonic 
postpartum hemorrhage. For example  further delineation of genital tract trauma may be 
warranted; although episiotomy or perineal tear (OR 1.67  95% 1.28–2.18) is included in 
some current risk-assessment tools  high vaginal laceration and cervical laceration are not 
(OR 2.19  95% 1.13–4.24  and 5.70  95% 2.56–12.67  respectively).
The data for oxytocin exposure  which also are already included in current risk-assessment 
tools  presented the most significant challenge in the interpretation of results for this 
systematic review. Although qualitative synthesis suggested an association between 
predelivery oxytocin exposure and atonic postpartum hemorrhage  the meta-analysis failed 
to confirm the association (combined OR 1.15  95% 0.95–1.40). Importantly  two low risk of 
bias studies were not included in the meta-analysis because of heterogeneity in defining the 
exposure and reference ranges (eg  evaluating oxytocin per unit dose). With conflicting 
results  it is essential also to consider the mechanism by which oxytocin likely contributes to 
atonic postpartum hemorrhage  namely that tachyphylaxis to oxytocin occurs during labor  
thereby decreasing efficacy of the primary drug used for the active management the third 
stage of labor.31–33 Further investigation is needed to determine the cut-offs for the amount 
or duration of oxytocin that leads to an increased risk of atony.
Although the risk-assessment tools may be refined by adding  keeping or removing risk 
factors  the individual weights and whether each individually or in combination defines an 
individual patient’s postpartum hemorrhage risk as moderate or high remains undetermined. 
When preparing and allocating resources for potential postpartum hemorrhage  the use of 
risk scores that weigh the variable contribution of risk factors may be preferable to the use of 
tools that merely collate a list of diagnoses with many associated or overlapping risk factors. Ende et al. Page 7

###8###To this end  recent headway has been made in using statistical modeling and machine 
learning to predict postpartum hemorrhage.34 Notably  however  a substantial proportion of 
postpartum hemorrhage occurs in the absence of recognized risk factors.
The strengths of this systematic review include the systematic approach to identifying all 
publications that included risk factors for atonic postpartum hemorrhage and the division of 
risk factors into maternal  pregnancy-related  labor-related  and delivery-related conditions 
to provide a logical progression of possible etiologies of atonic postpartum hemorrhage. 
Finally  we evaluated each variable  both qualitatively and quantitatively  to summarize a 
large number of studies in a comprehensive review. The results of this systematic review and 
meta-analysis  however  must be considered in the context of several limitations. First  we 
had to accept the authors’ definitions of atonic postpartum hemorrhage  which varied from 
study to study. The most common definitions in large database studies were rather 
consistent  using International Classification of Diseases codes for postpartum hemorrhage 
due to atony. The variability occurred primarily in the smaller studies  which used 
definitions of postpartum hemorrhage that included estimated blood loss  postpartum 
hemoglobin or hematocrit drop  and clinical diagnosis  with additional definitions for the 
diagnosis of atony including uterotonic administration  medical team diagnosis  or other 
surgical interventions. These definitions represent a spectrum of pathology  and each study’s 
definition may have affected the magnitude of associations of any given risk factor. Second  
because all authors were fluent only in English  we restricted our search to English-language 
studies  which contributed to publication bias. Third  for thoroughness we did include in the 
narrative summary studies with a high risk of bias; however  we included only studies with a 
low or moderate risk of bias when evaluating each risk factor  both qualitatively and 
quantitatively. Fourth  the types of effect estimates reported and the factors used to adjust for 
potential confounding were heterogeneous across studies. Additionally  nearly all reported 
ORs and RRs reflect weak associations (range 1–2)  which are likely below the 
discriminatory ability of the included cohort and case–control studies. These observations 
may result from unmeasured bias or confounding.35 Lastly  to summarize risk factors 
qualitatively  we had to provide a unique definition to categorize a risk factor as definite  
likely  or unclear. Although these definitions were created de novo for this review  a post hoc 
evaluation revealed that for those variables designated definite risk factors  all (six of six) 
showed statistically significant combined OR. Of the variables designated likely  eight of 
nine were amenable to meta-analysis  and seven showed statistically significant increased 
odds of atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Finally  15 variables were classified as unclear risk 
factors  with only six of those demonstrating data homogeneous enough for meta-analysis  
and of those  only one (macrosomia) demonstrated a statistically significant OR.
In summary  this systematic review and meta-analysis of risk factors for postpartum 
hemorrhage due to uterine atony provides critical insights to help guide future obstetric care. 
By more narrowly defining our focus to only atonic postpartum hemorrhage  we aimed to 
provide more definitive evidence supporting or refuting presumed risk factors  given that 
each etiology of postpartum hemorrhage likely has a unique set of contributing factors. 
These findings should lead researchers and clinicians to refine current risk-assessment tools 
further. Future tools should include weighted values for risk factors or modeling risk levels Ende et al. Page 8
