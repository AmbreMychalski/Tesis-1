Abstract: Objective—to overview  compare and generalize results of randomized clinical trials an-
alyzing different oxytocin doses to prevent postpartum hemorrhage  initiate and maintain uterine
contraction after Caesarean delivery. Methods—‘PubMed’  ‘EMBASE’  ‘CENTRAL’  and ‘CINAHL’
electronic databases were searched for clinical trials analyzing the effectiveness of different dose
of oxytocin given intravenously during surgery for uterine contraction and to reduce postpartum
hemorrhage. A systematic review of relevant literature sources was performed. Results—our
search revealed 813 literature sources. A total of 15 randomized clinical trials  comparing different
doses of oxytocin bolus and infusion used after caesarean delivery have met the selection criteria.
Conclusion—oxytocin bolus 0.5–3 UI is considered an effective prophylactic dose. Recommended
effective prophylactic oxytocin infusion dose is 7.72 IU/h  but it is unanswered whether we really
need a prophylactic infusion of oxytocin if we choose effective bolus dose size and rate. Adverse
hemodynamic effects were observed when a 5 UI oxytocin bolus was used. However  topics such
as bolus dose size  infusion dose size and requirement as well as bolus injection rate  still remain
unanswered. The doses that are recommended in the guidelines of peripartum hemorrhage prophy-
laxis are not conﬁrmed by randomized controlled double-blind trials and more research should cover
this topic.
Keywords: oxytocin; uterine contraction; caesarean delivery; hemorrhage
1. Introduction
Early postpartum hemorrhage can occur if oxytocin is not used or if the dose of its
bolus or infusion is too small. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist
deﬁnes early (primary) postpartum hemorrhage as at 1000 mL or more of total blood
loss or loss of blood accompanied by signs and symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 h
following the delivery  including intrapartum loss [ 1]. The Royal College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists divides it into minor (500–1000 mL) and major (1000 mL and more)
categories. They also deﬁne late (secondary) postpartum hemorrhage as abnormal or
excessive bleeding later than 24 h post-birth but no later than 12 weeks [ 2]. Parturient
hemorrhage has been the main cause of maternal morbidity and mortality for many years
all over the world. Postpartum hemorrhage is one of the most common complications
after caesarean delivery  which is an important surgical intervention performed in obstetric
practice. This has to be considered because caesarean delivery rates in the developing
world countries keep getting higher [ 3 4]. Minimizing the amount of blood lost during
caesarean delivery has a great beneﬁt to decrease postoperative morbidity and to decrease
the risks associated with blood transfusions. The routine use of oxytocin correlates with a
signiﬁcant reduction in the occurrence of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) [5–7].
Finding an optimal dose of oxytocin in patients undergoing caesarean delivery is a
problem of great importance because it is mandatory to achieve an adequate balance be-

3. Results
3.1. Study Selection Process
The research yielded 813 results  extracted from one database. All duplicates were
removed  526 articles were checked manually for relevance by screening their titles and
abstracts. A total 120 results met the inclusion criteria  but only 15 were included after a
full-text review. Only full-text articles were selected because the information given in the
abstract was not sufﬁcient for the thorough analysis. The randomized trials  conducted
in 2008–2020  which compared different doses of oxytocin or oxytocin and placebo given
for patients during CD  in order to investigate the effect of the drug on PPH and uterine
contraction  were analyzed. A total of 105 publications were excluded for reasons explained
in Picture 1.
3.2. Characteristics of Included Studies
Those 15 selected trials could be divided into several groups: those that investigate
different bolus dose (5 trials)  those that investigate different infusion dose (9 trials)  and
those that investigate both (1 trial). A summary of the results of 15 analyzed studies is
provided in Table 1.
3.3. Synthesis of Results
All 15 trials (bolus/infusion/both) included in this systematic review were investi-
gated and compared in 4 categories: PPH and blood loss  uterine contraction  and hemody-
namics. The summarized results can be seen in Table 2.
Butwick and colleagues compared 75 women divided into 5 groups to receive 0  0.5 
1  3  or 5 IU oxytocin bolus intravenously  diluted with 5 mL of 0.9% normal saline and
administered over the time period of 15 s. Adequate uterine tonus was measured at 2 
3  6  and 9 min. There were no signiﬁcant differences of adequate uterine tonus at 2 min
between the groups. Sixty-six per cent of participants in the placebo group had adequate
uterine tonus at 3 min and 100% of the parturient receiving 3 IU of oxytocin ( p= 0.04). This
study results indicated that adequate uterine tonus for patients during caesarean delivery
can be achieved using a small  0.5–3 IU bolus of oxytocin plus continuous infusion of
250 mL normal saline with 10 IU of oxytocin [8].
Sartain with co-authors studied data of 80 women  who were given 2 IU or 5 IU
oxytocin bolus over 5–10 s and oxytocin infusion of at rate 10 IU/h for 4 h (40 IU totally)
after delivery. No difference was found in blood loss  uterine tone  or need for additional
uterotonic drugs. Nonetheless  heart rate was found higher  mean arterial pressure was
found smaller  and frequency of nausea and antiemetic drugs were bigger in the 5 IU
oxytocin bolus group [9].
Somjit and co-authors compared 5 IU and 10 IU oxytocin bolus infused over 15 s and
followed by the infusion with 20 IU of oxytocin (2.5 IU/h) impact on uterine contraction.
Fewer patients  who received 10 IU oxytocin bolus needed additional uterotonic agents.
Blood loss and the uterine tone did not differ signiﬁcantly. They concluded that 5 IU was
non-inferior to 10 IU oxytocin [10].
King with co-authors investigated the impact of 5 IU oxytocin bolus injected over
30 s on women who have at least one risk factor for uterine atony. One hundred and
forty-three participants were divided into 2 groups: one group received 5 IU oxytocin bolus
followed by 40 IU in 500 mL and 20 IU in 1 L saline oxytocin infusions and the second were
given placebo bolus. The number of women requiring an additional dose of uterotonic
agents was similar in both groups. They found a signiﬁcant difference in uterine tone
after delivery  which was bigger in the group who received 5 IU oxytocin bolus ( p< 0.001).
However  this result was transient and disappeared after 5 min. Therefore  this study
revealed that there is no difference in PPH between women who receive oxytocin bolus
and those who do not [11].

Jonsson with colleagues investigated 5 and 10 IU of oxytocin IV bolus  injected over
1 min  impact on electrocardiography. Further doses of uterotonic drugs were available
upon request. They found a signiﬁcant difference in the occurrence of ST depressions
associated with oxytocin administration. The conclusion was that 5 IU has less effect on
changes in ECG [12].
Kovacheva and colleagues from Boston conducted a study where one group of
30 women received 3 IU oxytocin bolus (over 15 s) and 500 mL saline infusion and the
other group of the same size were given placebo bolus and 30 IU oxytocin in 500 mL
infusion. Both groups received additional oxytocin according to uterine tone  assessed
between 3 min and 12 min  if necessary. Women who received oxytocin bolus also received
less oxytocin overall to achieve adequate uterine tone. No differences in hemodynamic or
blood loss occurred [13].
Cecilia and colleagues conducted a trial of 271 women randomized into 2 groups: the
ﬁrst group received 10 IU of oxytocin in 500 mL of ﬂuids over 2–4 h  while the second
group was given 30 IU of oxytocin in 1500 mL of ﬂuids over 8–12 h. The atonic uterus
was seen in 1 patient from the ﬁrst group and 7 women from the second group ( p= 0.03).
Postoperative fall in blood pressure  tachycardia  and amount of blood loss during the
operation and postoperative period and blood transfusions were similar between groups.
The conclusion was that a low-dose oxytocin regimen is as effective as a high-dose oxytocin
regimen in the prevention of PPH in the postoperative period after caesarean delivery [ 14].
Ghulmiyyah and colleagues randomly assigned 189 patients into 3 groups where
women received 20  30  or 40 IU of oxytocin in 500 mL solution over 30 min. No signiﬁcant
difference in the change of hemoglobin concentration was observed. This implies that 20 IU
oxytocin diluted in 500 mL solution is an appropriate dose for the prevention of PPH [ 15].
Dufﬁeld with colleagues included 51 women: 24 patients received 10 IU of oxytocin
in 1 L solution and 27 received 60 IU of oxytocin in 1 L solution. Additional bolus doses of
1 IU oxytocin were given after evaluating uterine contraction between 2 min and 20 min at
2 min intervals if requested. They did not observe any statistically signiﬁcant difference
in excessive blood loss between groups  concluding that both low and high infusion of
oxytocin works in the same preventive regime [16].
Gungorduk and co-authors investigated 360 women who were given 5 IU of oxytocin
bolus (over 5–10 s) and consecutive infusion with placebo and other 360 participants re-
ceived 5 IU of oxytocin bolus and consecutive infusion of 30 IU of oxytocin. Mean estimated
blood loss ( p< 0.001) greater than 1000 mL were signiﬁcantly less in the group of patients
who were given 30 IU oxytocin infusion. More women in the placebo group required an
additional uterotonic agent ( p< 0.001) and blood transfusion ( p= 0.03). This study revealed
that 30 IU oxytocin infusion given after bolus lowers the blood loss after CD [17].
Kajendran with other researchers aimed to ﬁnd out the difference in blood loss between
two groups of patients  who were given 5 IU oxytocin bolus over 5–10 and 46 were given
20 IU oxytocin in 500 mL saline  and the other half were given just 500 mL saline later. The
blood loss in the group of 20 IU oxytocin infusion was signiﬁcantly less ( p= 0.046). Visual
estimation of blood loss made by the surgeon ( p= 0.01) and anesthetist ( p= 0.03) was also
signiﬁcantly higher in the placebo group [18].
McLeod studied hemodynamic differences between 2 groups of women: both groups
were given 5 UI oxytocin bolus over 3 min and 39 patients received 30 UI oxytocin infusion
or 35 women were given placebo infusion. There were no signiﬁcant differences between
groups during the 4-h study period. An additional oxytocin infusion after the bolus does
not have a signiﬁcant impact on patient hemodynamic [19].
Murphy with other scientists compared the blood loss of 110 women divided in
the same 2 groups as McLeod did. They favored the group with oxytocin infusion be-
cause the blood loss was lower  PPH occurred rarely and almost none needed additional
uterotonic agent [20].
Sheehan with co-authors conducted a study of 2058 women  who received 5 IU
bolus over 1 min  but half of them were given 40 IU oxytocin infusion ant others were
###9###Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021  18  5029 9 of 14
given a placebo infusion. No difference was found in PPH between groups ( p= 0.86).
There was a signiﬁcant difference in uterotonic agent need  it was higher in the placebo
group ( p< 0.001) [21].
Qian and others conducted a trial in 2018 to ﬁnd out the rate of oxytocin infusion.
All 150 women received 1 IU bolus of oxytocin followed by an oxytocin infusion at
0  1  3  5  8 IU/h. They found a 95% effective dose to be 7.72 IU/h and that the total
oxytocin dose administered after delivery could be decreased if an infusion of oxytocin
is given [22].
4. Discussion
Prophylactic uterotonic agents can prevent PPH and are routinely recommended.
A systematic Cochrane review on uterotonic agents  which included 196 clinical trials
(135 559 women)  and was published in 2018  concluded that oxytocin is effective for
preventing peripartum hemorrhage when compared with placebo or no treatment. Er-
gometrine plus oxytocin combination  misoprostol plus oxytocin combination and car-
betocin may have some additional desirable effects compared with oxytocin  but the
combination of two drugs is associated with more frequent side effects [23].
The main concern related to this topic is that there is not one opinion on what dosage of
the uterotonic drug should be administered to prevent uterine atony and PPH. Despite the
fact that oxytocin is used in everyday obstetric practice  it seems that it is used empirically.
The guidelines present a wide variety of oxytocin bolus doses and different infusion dose
and rate and are based on expert opinion mostly  that means that recommendations are
not strong.
The current WHO recommendation  published in 2018  for preventing PPH is 10 IU of
intramuscular or intravenous oxytocin for the prevention of PPH for all births. That dose is
not related to a high rate of side effects and it also can be divided into a smaller intravenous
bolus and an infusion. A rapid intravenous bolus injection must be avoided. One of the
important research priorities indicated by WHO is the identiﬁcation of the optimal regimen
of intravenous oxytocin at caesarean section [24].
A study conducted in Canada in 2016–2017 showed that for both high- and low-
risk CD participants doctors use 5 IU IV oxytocin bolus  although the range differs from
3 to 10 IU. In addition to bolus  they also use an infusion: 20 IU (range 20–40)/L for low-risk
CD and 40 IU (range 20–60)/L for high-risk CD [ 25]. This study inspired the release of a
newly updated guideline in Canada. However  the same recommendation concerning CD
remained as in the 2009 version  stating that 100 g of carbetocin should be given as an IV
bolus over 1 min instead of continuous oxytocin infusion [ 26] The. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists also released updated recommendations for postpartum
hemorrhage in 2017. But prevention of uterine atony was not discussed separately; the
closest recommendation was 10 IU of oxytocin bolus IV [ 27]. NATA consensus statements
on prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage were issued in 2019. They rec-
ommended administering an adjusted 5–10 IU intravenous oxytocin dose as the preferred
preventive treatment [ 28]. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in the
United Kingdom released updated recommendations for the prevention and management
of postpartum hemorrhage in 2016. They recommend the same 5 IU oxytocin dose by
slow IV injection [ 5]. Guidelines released in France in 2015 stated that for prevention of
postpartum hemorrhage after CD should be used 5–10 IU of oxytocin dose  injected slowly
(at least one-minute) IV [29].
It is very important to remember the fact that oxytocin is used for uterine atony
prophylactics for most obstetric patients as supplementation of endogenous oxytocin.
Carvalho dose-ﬁnding study results revealed that bolus should be only 0.35 IU  but it
should be followed by oxytocin infusion [30].
Balki and co-authors compared 30 women who were given 0.5 IU/mL IV oxytocin
after the delivery. If the patient did not respond adequately to the initial bolus of oxytocin 
the initial dose for the next patient was increased by 0.5 IU. All patients received 20 IU
###10###Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021  18  5029 10 of 14
oxytocin in 1 L saline. All patients who received 3.5 IU initial oxytocin dose showed
adequate uterine response within 1–2 min. An important fact is that all parturients were
given oxytocin before CD for a minimum of 2 h  so the sensitivity of oxytocin receptors
could be reduced. This study indicated that women undergoing CD for labor arrest require
approximately 3 IU of oxytocin as a bolus to achieve adequate uterine contraction and
continuous oxytocin infusion of 20 IU in 1 L saline after that [31].
These two studies revealed that an adequate dosage of oxytocin bolus can be as small
as 3 IU or even less and an additional continuous infusion of oxytocin is needed. The
previous oxytocin administration has no inﬂuence on the dose.
A cross-sectional study carried out by Beiranvand et al. concluded that the minimum
effective dose is 1 IU  and in those in labor progress 1–1.5 IU  both followed by 20 IU
oxytocin in 1000 mL infusion [ 32]. The previously mentioned up-down sequential method
study of Carvalho also resulted in a small minimum effective dose.
We analyzed 5 studies investigating superior bolus dose. The four trials comparing
constant continuous infusion of oxytocin and different bolus doses [ 10–13]  two of them
had the placebo group [ 10 13] found that smaller bolus dose or even no bolus dose has
the same effect as the bigger one. Sartain concluded that 2 IU is superior to 5 IU espe-
cially if hemodynamics was analyzed [ 11]. In the study of Butwick  more than a half of
patients in the placebo group didn’t require a bolus dose [ 10]  which is also conﬁrmed by
King  his study revealed that there is no difference in PPH between women who receive
oxytocin bolus and those who do not [ 13]. Jonsson conducted a trial without continuous
infusion and also concluded that a smaller dose has lower incidence of cardiovascular side
effects [ 14]. The cardiovascular effect of oxytocin is very important. It is detected that 10 IU
oxytocin bolus may cause temporary hypotension and tachycardia as well as myocardial
ischemia [ 33]. Therefore  when comparing the cardiovascular system response to oxytocin
dosage  a lower strategic tactic should be approached.
Both Cecilia  Ghulmiyyah  and partly King  investigated the effect of oxytocin infusion
without bolus dose. All of them found that the bolus of oxytocin is not necessary to achieve
adequate and wanted uterine contraction and prevent PPH and the smaller dose of oxytocin
(10–20) given as continuous infusion has the same effect as the bigger one [ 13 16 17].
This should also be taken into the consideration  as previously discussed  cardiovascular
changes are observed almost in every patient given at least 5 IU bolus of oxytocin  so the
strategy of using only the infusion of oxytocin could be further researched or bolus dose
should be as small as possible.
The inclusion criteria met only one study investigating different bolus doses and
continuous infusion of oxytocin. Kovacheva found out that the clinical effect is similar 
but additional doses of oxytocin and side effects are lower in the bolus group. The results
suggest that prophylactic bolus dose is sufﬁcient [ 15]. The possibility to avoid the infusion
dose helps to reduce the total dose of oxytocin.
Dufﬁeld compared low and high doses of oxytocin given as a continuous infusion.
That study conﬁrmed the previously mentioned result that both low (10 IU) and high
(60 IU) infusion of oxytocin works in the same preventive regime [18].
Although Dufﬁeld says that both high and low-dose infusions work in the same
way  receptor overstimulation should be taken into the consideration. It is known that
clinical use of high-dose of oxytocin infusion longer than 3 to 4 h may diminish the
response of uterus tonus to oxytocin [ 34]. Robinson and colleagues in their study about
oxytocin-induced desensitization of the oxytocin receptor concluded that oxytocin-induced
desensitization of myocytes to oxytocin stimulation occurred over a clinically relevant
time frame (4.2 h). Continued responsiveness of the cells to prostaglandin stimulation
after 6 h of oxytocin pre-treatment indicated that post-receptor signaling pathways were
maintained  which indicates that the oxytocin receptor is likely involved in the mechanism
of myocyte desensitization to oxytocin stimulation [ 34]. Especially if as high as 60 IU doses
of oxytocin were used to prevent PPH. High doses work in the same way as low ones do
###11###Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021  18  5029 11 of 14
because receptors cannot bind more hormone molecules to themselves  meaning that there
is no actual effect on uterine contraction after infusing oxytocin for too long and too much.
We included ﬁve studies that had a very similar design. The bolus dose of oxytocin
5 IU was given and it was followed by infusion with placebo or oxytocin. Oxytocin dose
ranged between studies from 20 to 40 IU. The conclusion is that additional oxytocin infusion
lowers the risk of PPH  reduces the need for additional uterotonic agents  and does not
have a signiﬁcant impact on patients’ hemodynamic [ 19–23]. The discussion remains if and
when the oxytocin  given as an infusion  is for prophylactic or for treatment of uterine atony
because the infused oxytocin dose in mentioned studies is more appropriate for uterine
atony treatment. The trials investigating the oxytocin effect on uterine tonus during CD 
have superiority over studies conducted in natural delivery because there is a possibility to
evaluate real uterine tonus visually and by palpation and to ﬁnd out the smallest effective
dose of the hormone.
One more point for discussion is the duration of oxytocin infusion. It is different
and ranges from one hour till 24 h between studies. We should take into account that
a long-lasting infusion could reduce the sensitivity of oxytocin receptors as mentioned
before and oxytocin could lose its power in the case of real uterine atony. Further  one more
unanswered question is what duration of continuous infusion should be considered as
prophylactic. It is known that clinical use of high-dose of oxytocin infusion longer than
3 to 4 h may diminish the response of uterus tonus to oxytocin [34].
The only study of Qian discusses prophylactic oxytocin infusion dose. They found
a 95% effective dose to be 7.72 IU/h and that the total oxytocin dose administered after
delivery can be decreased if the infusion of oxytocin is given [24].
The international consensus statement on the use of uterotonic agents during caesarean
section was published in 2019. Researchers from 8 different countries reached an agreement
that oxytocin is the ﬁrst-line drug in both elective and intrapartum CD. For the ﬁrst one
bolus of 1 IU oxytocin and infusion starting at 2.5–7.5 IU/h is recommended. For the latter 
3 IU oxytocin bolus over 30 s and infusion starting at 7.5–15 IU/h was decided [35].
Oxytocin given in very high doses  change the mean level of arterial blood pressure
in an opposing manner  however  under basal physiological conditions  oxytocin does
not contribute to blood pressure maintenance [ 36]. The hypotensive action of oxytocin 
demonstrated in animal models  is believed to be mediated by the direct effect on oxytocin
receptors in the heart and the indirect effect of the release of atrial natriuretic peptide  brain
natriuretic peptide  and nitric oxide in the cardiovascular tissues [ 30]. This hormone has
widely known cardiovascular side-effects  mostly in decreasing blood pressure by causing
peripheral vasodilation  increasing the HR  cases of myocardial ischemia  and arrhythmias.
Thomas with his colleagues examined the effect of 5 IU bolus and 5 IU oxytocin infusion
over 5 min. Both heart rate and blood pressure were lower in the bolus group  meaning
that bolus should be injected slower than it is widely used [37].
Langesaeter et al. with invasive monitoring (LiDCOPlus®monitor) in healthy preg-
nant women  observed an increase in cardiac index  decreased systemic vascular resistance 
and systolic blood pressure (range of 36–62 mmHg) 45 s after oxytocin injection [ 38].
This same group of authors studied 18 patients with preeclampsia who underwent ce-
sarean section. With the same monitoring as the previous study (LiDCOPlus®) connected
to the radial artery of patients  the authors found an increased heart rate and decreased
systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure in all patients receiving oxytocin (5 IU)
after delivery [ 39]. The hemodynamic instability that can occur during postpartum hemor-
rhage may not be solely due to hypovolemia  but the association of both hypovolemia and
use of oxytocin bolus [40].
This review has several limitations. We could apply more strict inclusion criteria and
include only randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials. The meta-analysis would
provide more reliable results and conclusions; it’s an option for future work.
Most studies mentioned the rate of bolus injection and it ranges from 5 s till 3 min [ 10–
15 19–21 23 24]. Further research investigating prophylactic bolus dose infusion rate is
###12###Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021  18  5029 12 of 14
necessary. It is possible that the slower bolus infusion rate could reduce the frequency of
side effects  or the request of additional doses of uterotonic drugs  or even the necessity of
oxytocin prophylactic infusion.
5. Conclusions
Oxytocin is the routinely used and effective uterotonic drug  but the unanswered
topic still remains the bolus dose size  infusion dose size and requirement and bolus
injection rate. The doses that are recommended in the guidelines of peripartum hemorrhage
prophylaxis are not conﬁrmed by randomized controlled double-blind trials and are only
supported by expert opinion and studies with low evidence rates. Oxytocin bolus 0.5–3 UI
is considered an effective prophylactic dose. The effective prophylactic oxytocin infusion
dose is 7.72 I U/h. However  it is unanswered whether this prophylactic infusion dose of
oxytocin is required if an effective bolus dose  size and rate are chosen. In the cases we use
an oxytocin infusion we should separate if it is the prophylactic infusion or the treatment
of atony. Adverse hemodynamic effects were observed when a 5 UI oxytocin bolus was
used. This must be taken into consideration  especially among female patients with any
pre-existing heart conditions. One of the important research priorities is the identiﬁcation
of the optimal regiment of intravenous oxytocin at caesarean section.
