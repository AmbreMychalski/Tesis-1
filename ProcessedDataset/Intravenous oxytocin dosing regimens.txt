Introduction
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is one of
the leading causes of maternal mortality accounting for nearly 20%1of the
295 000 maternal deaths that occurworldwide.
2The most common cause ofPPH is uterine atony 3hence increasing
the use of uteronics for all women duringdelivery has been a key component of

following cesarean delivery.
DATA SOURCES: We searched Ovid MEDLINE  Embase  Global Index Medicus  Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature 
Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials  ClinicalTrials.gov   and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for eligible studies pub-
lished until February 2020.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included any randomized or nonrandomized study published in peer-reviewed journals that compared
at least 2 different dosing regimens of intravenous oxytocin for postpartum hemorrhage prevention in women undergoing cesarean
delivery.
METHODS: Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies  extracted the data  and assessed the risk of bias. The primary
outcome was incidence of postpartum hemorrhage /C211000 mL. Other review outcomes included use of additional uterotonics  blood loss 
and adverse maternal events. Data were analyzed according to the type of intravenous administration (bolus only  infusion only  or bolusplus infusion) and total oxytocin dose. A meta-analysis was performed on randomized trials and the results were reported as risk ratios ormean differences with 95% conﬁdence intervals. The Grading of Recommendations  Assessment  Development  and Evaluations scalewas used to rate the certainty of evidence. Findings from dose-ﬁnding trials and nonrandomized studies were reported narratively.
RESULTS: A total of 35 studies (7333 women) met our inclusion criteria and included 30 randomized trials and 5 nonrandomized studies.
There were limited data available from the trials for most outcomes  and the results were not conclusive. Compared with bolus plus infusion
regimens  bolus only regimens probably result in slightly higher mean blood loss (mean difference  52 mL; 95% conﬁdence interval  0.4 e104
mL; moderate certainty). Among the bolus plus infusion regimens  initial bolus doses <5 IU may reduce nausea (risk ratio  0.26; 95%
conﬁdence interval  0.11 e0.63; low certainty) when compared with doses of 5 e9 IU. Total oxytocin doses of 5 e9 IU vs total doses of 10 e19
IU may increase the use of additional uterotonics (risk ratio  13.00; 95% conﬁdence interval  1.75 e96.37; low certainty). Effects on other
outcomes were generally inconclusive.
CONCLUSION: There are limited data available for comparisons of IV oxytocin regimens for postpartum hemorrhage prevention following
cesarean delivery. Bolus plus infusion regimens may lead to minor reductions in mean blood loss and initial bolus doses of <5 IU may
minimize nausea. Bolus only regimens of 10 IU vs bolus only regimens of 5 IU may decrease the need for additional uterotonics  however 
further comparative trials are required to understand the effects on other key outcomes  particularly hypotension.

###2###global efforts to reduce PPH-associated
morbidity and mortality.4
In 2018  the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) recommended that 10 in-ternational units (IU) of oxytocin shouldbe administered to all women duringdelivery  irrespective of the mode of de-livery (vaginal or cesarean delivery[CD]).
4This recommendation was
informed by a Cochrane network meta-
analysis of uterotonic agents for PPH
prevention by Gallos et al.5Based on
further evidence from observationalstudies suggesting dose-dependentadverse effects 
4the WHO recommen-
dations speci ﬁed that when used for PPH
prevention during CD  10 IU oxytocinshould be administered as a divided dose
using a smaller initial intravenous (IV)
bolus followed by infusion.
4However 
the WHO Guideline DevelopmentGroup acknowledged that there wasinsufﬁcient evidence from randomized
controlled trials and speci ﬁed that
identifying an optimal IV oxygocinregimen for PPH prophylaxis during CD
was a high research priority.
4
Previous reports have synthesized ev-
idence on oxytocin dosing regimens forPPH prevention during CD  however none of these were systematic reviews orwere published nearly a decade ago.
6e8
An up-to-date review and comparisonof studies are important to help guide
clinical practice and address the priority
identi ﬁed by the WHO Guideline
Development Group. The aim of thissystematic review was  therefore  toidentify and compare IVoxytocin dosingregimens during CD and determinewhether any regimens are superior.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review inaccordance with the Preferred ReportingItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance
9(Appendix
A). We followed a prespeci ﬁed protocol
registered with the International Prospec-tive Register of Systematic Reviews(CRD42020175544) 
10and outlined any
deviations in Appendix B .E t h i c s
approval was not required because thiswas a systematic review of publiclyavailable data.
Eligibility criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) andnonrandomized studies of interventions
(NRSIs) published in peer-reviewed
journals were eligible for inclusionwithout date restrictions. Conferenceabstracts were not included. We includedstudies written in English and thosewritten in other languages if we were ableto obtain adequate translations.Eligible studies were those that
included women who gave birth at anygestational age to a live or stillborn babyvia CD and included both planned andintrapartum CDs. Women were eligibleif they received IV oxytocin for PPHprevention either at or around the thirdstage of labor  recognizing that admin-
istration of oxytocin during the third
stage may not be possible or practicalduring a CD  particularly during anemergency CD.
Studies comparing at least 2 different
IV dosing regimens of oxytocin duringCD were eligible. Trials with coad-ministered interventions were eligible 
provided that the use of cointerventions
was identical in all trial arms.
Outcomes of interest
We prespeci ﬁed 25 outcomes based on
those used in the WHO recommenda-tions on uterotonics for PPH preven-tion 
4the PPH core outcome set 11and
the 2019 Cochrane network meta-
analysis on uterotonics for PPH pre-vention.
5The primary review outcome
was incidence of PPH /C211000 mL  with
secondary outcomes including PPH/C21500 mL  maternal death  severe
maternal morbidity (intensive care unit[ICU] admissions)  severe maternal
morbidity (shock)  use of additional
uterotonics  satisfactory uterine tone use of surgical or invasive nonsurgicalinterventions  blood transfusion  meanvolumes of blood loss  change in he-moglobin measurements before vs afterbirth  any adverse maternal events(including nausea  vomiting  headache 
hypotension  chest pain  myocardial
ischemia  cardiac arrythmia  dyspnea bradycardia  tachycardia  or waterintoxication)  breastfeeding at hospitaldischarge  maternal sense of well-being and maternal satisfaction.
Information sources  search strategy 
and study selection
A search strategy was developed inconsultation with an informationspecialist ( Supplemental Table 1 ). Be-
tween February 14  2020  and February19  2020  we searched the following 7electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE Embase  Global Index Medicus AJOG at a Glance
Why was this study conducted?
The World Health Organization guidelines state that there is insuf ﬁcient evidence
to recommend a speci ﬁc oxytocin dosing regimen to prevent women from
experiencing postpartum hemorrhage following a cesarean delivery. This sys-tematic review was conducted to identify and compare intravenous oxytocindosing regimens administered during cesarean deliveries and to determinewhether any regimens are superior.
Keyﬁndings
We found limited and generally low-quality data for most outcomes and further
research is required. Bolus plus infusion regimens  with an initial bolus dose of<5 international units (IU)  may have minor bene ﬁts. Bolus only regimens of 10
IU vs 5 IU may decrease the use of additional uterotonics  although the effects onadverse events (particularly hypotension) is unknown.
What does this add to what is known?
This study compared data on all oxytocin regimens administered during cesareandelivery for postpartum hemorrhage prevention. It provides valuable informationfor clinical guidelines and future research.ajog.org Systematic Reviews

###3###Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied
Health Literature  Cochrane CentralRegister of Controlled Trials ClinicalTrials.gov   and WHO Interna-
tional Clinical Trials Registry Platform.Recovered citations were de-duplicatedusing Endnote (Clarivate Analytics Philadelphia  PA)
12and imported into
Covidence (Covidence  Melbourne 
Australia)13for screening. Each unique
citation was reviewed and independentlyassessed by 2 review authors (L.C.P. E.K.F.  and M.C.) for inclusion  initiallybased on titles and abstracts and then onthe full-text articles of potentially eligiblecitations. Disagreements were resolved
through discussion or consultation with
another reviewer (J.P .V.). We alsoscreened the reference lists of allincluded studies  in addition to thereference list of the Gallos et al
5network
meta-analysis for additional eligiblestudies.
Data extraction and assessment of risk
of biasFor each study  2 reviewers (L.C.P . E.K.F.  M.C.) double-extracted data us-ing a predesigned and pretested elec-tronic spreadsheet (Google Sheets). Dataabout the study design  year of publica-tion  period of recruitment  number of
participants  maternal age  gestational
age  primary and secondary review out-comes  and potential effect modi ﬁers
(type of CD  previous oxytocin admin-istration during childbirth  and previousrisk for PPH) were extracted. Disagree-ments between the reviewers at the titleand abstract  and full-text stages were
4% and 9%  respectively  and were
resolved through discussion or consul-tation with another reviewer (J.P.V.). Weattempted to contact the study authorsfor all studies for which further infor-mation was required.
Each included study was assessed for
risk of bias by at least 2 review authors
(L.C.P .  E.K.F.  M.C.). RCTs were assessed
using the Cochrane Risk Of Bias 2.0(ROB 2.0  Cochrane  London  UnitedKingdom) tool 
14and NRSIs were
assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions(ROBINS-I  Cochrane) tool.
15We made
an explicit judgment about the overallrisk of bias for each included study. In
addition  we assessed the risk of bias ofblood loss measurements using a similarapproach to Gallos et al
5(Supplemental
Table 2 ). Extracted data about the re-
view outcomes from RCTs were enteredinto the Review Manager 5 software(Cochrane)
16for the meta-analysis. Data
from NRSIs were reported narratively.
Data synthesis
We identi ﬁed the following 3 types of
studies: comparative RCTs with /C212
arms  dose- ﬁnding RCTs  and NRSIs.
Comparative randomized controlled trials.
For comparative RCTs  we ﬁrst assessed
trial populations and methods usedbetween trials to judge whether theywere suf ﬁciently similar to warrant a
meta-analysis. A random-effects modelwas used to assess all outcomes with >1
trial. Results from dichotomous datawere presented as a summary risk ratio
(RR) with 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CI)
and as mean differences (MDs) forcontinuous data. For all meta-analyseswe used the Grading of Recommenda-tions Assessment  Development  andEvaluation (GRADE) approach
17to rate
the certainty of evidence as very low  low moderate  or high using GRADEpro
software (Evidence Prime  Inc  Ontario 
Canada).
18We planned to assess publi-
cation bias using funnel plots if there were10 or more studies included in the meta-analysis  however  this was not donebecause of the limited number of studies.
We conducted separate meta-analyses
for (1) type of IV administration (bolus
only  infusion only  or bolus plus infu-
sion) and (2) total oxytocin doseadministered. We calculated the totaloxytocin dose for each trial arm byadding all preplanned doses of oxytocindescribed in the study methods including any doses used in a bolus short infusion  and maintenance infu-
sion (studies were not included for
analysis of total oxytocin dose if therewas insuf ﬁcient information to deter-
mine the total dose). Considering theavailable evidence (and to standardizethe analyses)  trial arms were groupedinto 5 total oxytocin dose categories ( <5
IU  5e9I U  1 0 e19 IU  20 e49 IU  and/C2150 IU) for comparison in pairwise
analyses. In addition  among trials usingbolus plus infusion regimens  we iden-tiﬁed trials that studied the effects of
using different initial bolus doses byvarying the initial bolus dose whilekeeping the infusion component iden-tical between trial arms. Hence  we also
analyzed (3) the effects of different initial
bolus doses among trials using bolusplus infusion regimens. To accomplishthis  we grouped the initial bolus doses as<5 IU  5 IU  or 10 IU for comparison in
pairwise analyses.
In line with the 2019 international
consensus statement recommendation of
a 2- to 4-hour maintenance infusion 
8we
performed a subgroup analysis on studiesthat used a maintenance infusion be-tween 2 and 4 hours only. Owing tolimited available data  we were only ableto perform this for the analysis of initialbolus doses in a bolus plus infusionregimen.
We planned to conduct subgroup
analyses by type of CD (planned vsintrapartum)  previous oxytocin admin-istration  and previous risk of PPH however  these were not possible becauseof limited available data. We performedsensitivity analyses for risk of bias (onlyincluding studies with an overall low risk
of bias) and method of blood loss esti-
mation (only including studies that usedcalculated or volumetric assessment ofblood loss). When making statements onthe effects of an intervention  we adoptedstandardized language derived from San-tesso et al.
19
Dose- ﬁnding trials and nonrandomized
studies.The dose- ﬁnding RCTs used a 1-arm up-
and-down sequential allocation methodin which the oxytocin dose for the nextparticipant was adjusted according to theresponse of the preceding participant.
20
For example  if the ﬁrst participant had
a satisfactory response  the next partici-
pant was allocated either an equal orlower dose using a biased-coin technique.Dose- ﬁnding trials did not make explicit 
pairwise comparisons between dosingregimens  hence ﬁndings from these trials
were reported narratively. Eligible NRSIswere also reported narratively.Systematic Reviews ajog.org

###4###Results
Study selection and characteristics
The results of the search are summarizedin the PRISMA ﬂow diagram ( Figure 1 ).
We identi ﬁed 9631 records of which
6626 records were excluded at the title
and abstract screening stage and 195 at
the full-text review stage. The mostcommon reasons for exclusion wereduplicate study (n ¼72) and wrong
article type (n ¼37). No further articles
were identi ﬁed through screening of the
reference lists. In total  35 studies of 7333women were included. We found 30
RCTs of which 26 were comparative
RCTs and 4 were dose- ﬁnding RCTs. We
found 5 NRSIs of which 4 werecomparative and 1 was a dose- ﬁnding
study. A summary of the study charac-teristics and an overview of study com-parisons are provided in Tables 1 to 4
andSupplemental Table 3 . Among the 26
comparative RCTs included  9 were at an
overall high risk for bias and 15 were atlow risk for bias ( Supplemental Figures 1
and 2); the 4 dose- ﬁnding RCTs were
assessed to be at an overall high risk forbias. Of the 5 NRSIs  2 were assessed tobe at an overall critical risk of bias andthe remaining 3 as at moderate risk
(Supplemental Figures 3 and4).
Comparative randomized controlled
trialsWe identi ﬁed 26 comparative RCTs (64
trial arms) that included 5271 women.Of these  19 RCTs were 2-arm trials  and7 RCTs were multi-arm trials (rangingfrom 3e6 arms). Sample sizes ranged
from 28 e2069 women  and 23 trials
included women undergoing planned
CD only. The types of IVadministrationsused were bolus only (14 arms)  infusiononly (23 arms)  and bolus plus infusion(27 arms). There were 26 different totaldoses of oxytocin used ranging from 1IUe260 IU. The most common total
doses were 5 IU (11 arms) and 10 IU (8
arms). We could not calculate the total
dose for 3 of the studies.
25 27 35Among
those trial arms that used an infusioncomponent  the total infusion durationranged from 5 minutes to 24 hours  andthe rate of oxytocin administration var-ied from 0.7 IU per hour to 120 IU perhour. Among the 5 trials that compareddifferent initial bolus doses within a
bolus plus infusion regimen  the initial
bolus doses ranged from 0.5 e10 IU.
Dose- ﬁnding trials and
nonrandomized studiesWe identi ﬁed 4 dose- ﬁnding RCTs (180
women). The sample sizes ranged from30e70 women. Two trials included
women undergoing planned CD only
and 1 trial included women undergoingintrapartum CD only. All studies usedeither an initial bolus or infusion fol-lowed by a maintenance infusion. Wefound 5 NRSIs that included 1840women with sample sizes ranging from41e1122 women. Of these  4 werecomparative studies (3 2-arm studies  1
3-arm study) and 1 was a dose- ﬁnding
study. The most common type of IVadministration was bolus only (4 arms).Doses ranged from 3 e80 IU with the
most common dose being 5 IU (2 arms).
Outcomes
The most commonly reported outcomes
were the use of additional uterotonics
(28 studies) and mean blood loss (20studies). No data were available for 7outcomes (maternal deaths  ICU ad-missions  shock  water intoxication breastfeeding after discharge  maternalsense of well-being  and maternal senseof satisfaction ( Supplemental Table 4 ).FIGURE 1

###9###Synthesis of results
Meta-analysis.
Type of intravenous administration. A
total of 15 RCTs (3921 women)compared different types of IV admin-istration regimens ( Table 2  
Supplemental Table 5 ). The incidence of
PPH/C211000 mL was only reported for 1
comparison (bolus only vs bolus plusinfusion).
Bolus only vs infusion only. In 5 RCTs
(338 women)  bolus only regimens werecompared with infusion only regimens.No study reported on the outcome ofincidence of PPH /C211000 mL. The effects
of either dosing regimen on the use ofadditional uterotonics  mean blood loss or maternal adverse effects (nausea 
vomiting  chest pain  and myocardial
ischemia) are inconclusive because thecertainty of evidence was very low. Noother outcomes were reported.
Bolus only vs bolus plus infusion. In 5
RCTs (4580 women)  bolus only regi-mens were compared with bolus plusinfusion regimens. The effect of either
dosing regimen on the outcome of
incidence of PPH /C211000 mL was
inconclusive because the certainty ofevidence was very low (4 trials of 2976women; RR  1.44; 95% CI  0.75 e2.76;
very low certainty)  although bolus onlyregimens slightly increased the meanblood loss (5 trials of 3068 women; MD 
52 mL; 95% CI  0.4 e104 mL; moderate
certainty) ( Figure 2 ) and decreased the
incidence of satisfactory uterine tone (1trial of 145 women; RR  0.63; 95% CI 0.41e0.95; low certainty) ( Figure 3 ).
There were no clear differences in themean change in hemoglobin (3 trials of
2260 women; MD  e0.05 g/dL; 95% CI 
e0.27 to 0.17 g/dL; high certainty) or
incidence of blood transfusion (3 trialsof 2870 women; RR  1.55; 95% CI 0.47e5.13; low certainty). The effects of
either dosing regimen on the outcomesof incidence of PPH /C21500 mL  use of
additional uterotonics  and maternaladverse effects (hypotension  nausea 
and chest pain) were inconclusive
because the certainty of evidence wasvery low. There were zero events re-ported for surgical or nonsurgical in-terventions  vomiting  bradycardia tachycardia  and dyspnea. A sensitivityanalysis on risk of bias (including onlystudies at an overall low risk of bias)
suggested no clear difference in mean
blood loss.
Infusion only vs bolus plus infusion. In
5 RCTs (442 women)  infusion onlyregimens were compared with bolusplus infusion regimens. No study re-ported on the outcome of incidence ofPPH/C211000 mL. There were no clear
differences in the incidence of satisfac-

low certainty]). The effects on use ofadditional uterotonics  mean bloodloss  and nausea were inconclusivebecause the certainty of evidence wasvery low. There were zero events re-ported for surgical interventions  chestpain  and dyspnea.
Total oxytocin dose. A total of 17 RCTs
(4663 women) compared different totaloxytocin doses ( Table 3  Supplemental
Table 6 ). The outcome of the incidence
of PPH
/C211000 mL was reported for 2
comparisons ( <5I Uv s5 e9 IU and 5 e9
IU vs 20 e49 IU).
Total oxytocin dose of <5I Uv s5 e9
IU.One RCT40(145 women) compared
a total oxytocin dose of <5 IU with 5 e9
IU. It reported zero incidences of PPH/C211000 mL with either dosing regimen.
The effects on the use of additionaluterotonics  satisfactory uterine tone mean blood loss  or maternal adverseevents (nausea  hypotension  chest pain)
were inconclusive because the certainty
of evidence was very low. There werezero events reported for blood trans-fusions  vomiting  bradycardia  tachy-cardia  and dyspnea.
Total oxytocin dose of 5 e9I Uv s1 0 e19
IU.Three RCTs (177 women) compared
a total oxytocin dose of 5 e9 IU with
10e19 IU. No study reported on the
incidence of PPH /C211000 mL. The use of
a total dose of 5 e9I Uv s1 0 e19 IU may
result in a large increase in the use ofadditional uterotonics (2 trials of 137women; RR  13.00; 95% CI  1.75 e96.37;TABLE 4

clear difference in myocardial ischemia(1 trial of 103 women; RR  0.98; 95% CI 0.14e6.70; low certainty). The effect on
mean blood loss was inconclusive
because the certainty of evidence wasvery low. There were zero events re-ported for hypotension.
Total oxytocin dose of 5 e9I Uv s2 0 e49
IU.Four RCTs (2996 women) 
compared a total oxytocin dose of5e9I Uw i t h2 0 e49 IU. The effects of
either dosing regimen on the out-
comes of incidence of PPH /C211000
mL  PPH /C21500 mL  use of additional
uterotonics or blood transfusion  ormean blood loss were inconclusivebecause the certainty of evidence wasvery low. There was no clear differ-ence in the change in hemoglobin
(3 trials of 2260 women; MD  e0.05
g/dL; 95% CI  e0.27 to 0.17 g/dL; low
certainty).
Total oxytocin dose of 10 e19 IU vs
20e49 IU. Two RCTs (331 women)
compared a total oxytocin dose of 10 e19
IU with 20 e49 IU. Neither
study reported on the incidence of PPH
/C211000 mL. The use of a total dose of
10e19 IU compared with of 20 e49 IUprobably reduces chest pain (1 trial of
271 women; RR  0.05; 95% CI 0.00e0.81; moderate certainty)
(Supplemental Figure 5 ). There were no
clear differences in the incidence of
blood transfusion (1 trial of 271 women;RR  0.86; 95% CI  0.28 e2.62; low cer-
tainty)  satisfactory uterine tone (1 trialof 271 women; RR  1.05; 95% CI 1.00e1.09; moderate certainty)  or
tachycardia (1 trial of 271 women; RR 0.84; 95% CI  0.26 e2.69). The effects on
the use of additional uterotonics  mean
blood loss  nausea  or vomiting wereinconclusive because the certainty ofevidence was very low.
Total oxytocin dose of 20 e49 IU vs /C2150
IU.One RCT
36(321 women) compared
a total oxytocin dose of 20 e49 IU with
/C2150 IU. It did not report on the inci-
dence of PPH /C211000 mL. The use of
doses of 20 e49 IU compared with /C2150
IU may increase the use of additionaluterotonics (RR  2.07; 95% CI 1.42e3.01; low certainty) ( Supplemental
Figure 6 ). There were no clear differ-
ences in mean blood loss (MD  20 mL;95% CI  e14 to 54 mL; low certainty) or
hypotension (RR  1.05; 95% CI 
0.71e1.53; low certainty).Different bolus doses in bolus plus infusion
regimens. A total of 5 RCTs using
oxytocin regimens of bolus plus infusion(357 women) compared different initial
bolus doses while keeping the infusion
component identical for both trial arms(Table 4  Supplemental Table 7 ).
Initial bolus dose of <5 IU vs 5 IU in a
bolus plus infusion regimen. In 3 RCTs
(180 women) in which a bolus plusinfusion regimen was used  an initialbolus dose of <5 IU was compared with
that of 5 IU. No study reported on the
incidence of PPH /C211000 mL. Data from
all 3 trials showed that initial bolus dosesof<5 IU may reduce nausea (RR  0.29;
95% CI  0.10 e0.81; low certainty)
(Supplemental Figure 7 )  but there were
no clear differences in the use of addi-tional uterotonics (RR  1.08; 95% CI 
0.51e2.31; low certainty) or vomiting
(RR  0.23; 95% CI  0.05 e1.04; low cer-
tainty). The effect on mean blood losswas very uncertain owing to very lowcertainty about the evidence. There werezero events reported for surgical ornonsurgical interventions  blood trans-fusions  and maternal adverse events
(chest pain  cardiac arrythmia  dyspnea 
hypotension).FIGURE 2

###11###Initial bolus dose of 5 IU vs 10 IU in a
bolus plus infusion regimen. One RCT24
(87 women) that employed a bolus plus
infusion regimen compared an initialbolus dose of 5 IU with 10 IU. It did notreport on the incidence of PPH /C211000
mL and there were no clear differences in
mean blood loss (MD  2 mL; 95% CI 
e135 to 138 mL; low certainty)  cardiac
arrythmia (RR  0.34; 95% CI  0.01 e8.14;
low certainty)  or chest pain (RR  0.41;95% CI  0.08 e2.00; low certainty). There
were zero events reported for surgical ornonsurgical interventions and dyspnea.
We were largely unable to perform
sensitivity and subgroup analyses owing
to limited available data. However  wheredata permitted these analyses  no sig-niﬁcant effects were found except where
otherwise described.
Narrative synthesis.
We reviewed dose- ﬁnding RCTs and
NRSIs separately. Findings from thesestudies are inconclusive  however  wereport the main ﬁndings below. The re-
sults were not reported as statistically
signiﬁcant unless otherwise noted.
Dose- ﬁnding studies. A total of 4 dose-
ﬁnding RCTs (180 women) studied the
different initial doses required to initiateuterine contraction when followed by amaintenance infusion. No study re-ported on the incidence of PPH /C211000
mL. The studies found that small doses
(0.3 IU as a bolus or 0.27 e0.29 IU/min
as a short infusion) may be adequate toprevent uterine atony during plannedCD
48e50and that higher doses of
oxytocin may be required during intra-partum CD regardless of the type ofadministration.
47 50One dose- ﬁnding
NRSI55(83 women) reported that small
doses (1 IU as a bolus) may be adequateto prevent uterine atony  with higher
doses needed during intrapartum CD.
Hypotension  secondary to oxytocinadministration  was noted in all studies however  was not explored in relation tospeciﬁc doses or types of IV adminis-
tration regimens.Nonrandomized studies.Type of intravenous administration. One
study
52(1122 women  critical risk of bias)
compared bolus only with bolus plusinfusion regimens. It suggested that morewomen who received bolus only regi-mens experienced PPH /C211000 mL than
women who received bolus plus infusionregimens  greater use of additional ute-rotonics  and increased incidence in
blood transfusions. There were no sig-
niﬁcant differences reported for any other
outcomes.
52Another study53(454
women  moderate risk of bias) comparedinfusion only with bolus plus infusionregimens. It did not report on the inci-dence of PPH /C211000 mL but suggested
that women who received infusion only
regimens experienced a greater overall
decrease in hemoglobin levels.
Total oxytocin dose. One study
54(73
women  moderate risk of bias)compared a total oxytocin dose of 3 IUwith that of 5 IU. It did not report on theincidence of PPH /C211000 mL butsuggested more women who received 5
IU experienced vomiting whencompared with women who received 3IU. One study
52(1122 women  critical
risk of bias) compared a total oxytocindose of 5 IU with that of 10 IU and 15 IU.It suggested that increased doses of
oxytocin may result in less PPH /C211000
mL  the use of additional uterotonics andblood transfusions  and may lead tomore satisfactory uterine tone.
52One
study51(150 women  critical risk of bias)
compared a total oxytocin dose of 30 IUwith that of 80 IU. It did not report onthe incidence of PPH /C211000 mL but
suggested that 30 IU may lead to a sta-
tistically signi ﬁcant increase in the use of
additional uterotonics and a decrease insatisfactory uterine tone. No signi ﬁcant
differences were reported for any otheroutcomes including hypotension.
Comment
Main ﬁndings
We identi ﬁed 35 studies of 7333 women
comparing different IV oxytocin regi-mens for PPH prevention following CD.The evidence in general was limited anddata were lacking for most of the reviewoutcomes  with the data from 11 studiesat high or critical risk of bias. We did not
ﬁnd any clear differences in the incidence
of PPH /C211000 mL  although data were
sparse for this outcome. Bolus plusinfusion regimens are possibly superiorto bolus only regimens in terms of asmall reduction in mean blood loss(around 52 mL) and increased uterineFIGURE 4

###12###tone  although these ﬁndings were based
on a few trials. In general  we found noclear indication of a superior totaloxytocin dose (largely because of insuf-ﬁcient evidence). Although we found
doses of 10 e19 IU is possibly better than
doses of 5 e9 IU in terms of decreasing
the use of additional uterotonics  there
were limited data on adverse maternal
events (particularly hypotension). Ofinterest  both studies used in the meta-analysis of this outcome exclusivelycompared 5 IU with 10 IU in a bolus onlyregimen.
Oxytocin regimens were described
using varying time intervals  which
complicated meaningful comparison.
However  available evidence suggeststhat when administering oxytocin in abolus plus infusion regimen  initial bolusdoses of <5 IU may lead to less nausea 
but the effects of lower vs higher initialbolus doses on blood loss are not known.The infusion component of bolus plus
infusion regimens most commonly
continued for 2 e4 hours.
Findings from nonrandomized
studies  although not conclusive owingto a greater susceptibility to bias  werebroadly consistent with the ﬁndings of
meta-analyses on RCTs. These generallyindicated that bolus plus infusion regi-
mens may be superior to bolus only
regimens and that higher oxytocin dosesmay be more effective but can increaseadverse maternal events. Among thebolus plus infusion regimens  4 dose-ﬁnding RCTs reported that small initial
doses (0.3 IU as a bolus or 0.27 e0.29 IU/
min as a short infusion) may be adequate
to prevent uterine atony during planned
CD 
48e50with higher doses required at
intrapartum CD 47 50but the evidence
was not conclusive and should be inter-preted with caution.
Comparison with existing literature
Ourﬁndings are broadly consistent with
previous work on IV oxytocin dosing
regimens for PPH prevention followingat CD  including a 2012 systematic re-view
7of 7 RCTs (626 women) and a 2011
literature review.6Both reviews recom-
mended the use of a small initial bolusdose (ranging between 0.3 and 3 IU)
6 7
with 1 review further recommending abolus plus infusion regimen.7Both re-
views further reported more adversehemodynamic events with higher dosesof oxytocin  which is consistent with ourﬁndings. Our ﬁndings are compatible
with a 2019 international consensusstatement 
8which recommends using a 1
IU bolus followed by a 2.5 e7.5 IU/h
infusion over 2 e4 hours and the WHO
recommendation of 10 IU oxytocinadministered IVor intramuscular duringall births with doses divided into a smallinitial IV bolus with subsequent infusionduring CD.
4However  it is evident that
good-quality trials comparing differentoxytocin dosing regimens are needed to
guide practice. It is noteworthy to
mention that national guidelines vary(Supplemental Table 8 )  probably
reﬂecting the lack of clear evidence to
guide practice. The 2017 AmericanCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-gists guidelines recommend using adilute IV infusion (bolus dose of 10 IU)
for PPH prevention without speci ﬁca-
tion for mode of delivery.
57Australian
guidelines only recommend prophylac-tic oxytocin for all births without speci-fying a dosing regimen.
61Carbetocin is
recommended in Canada during plan-ned CD 
60and a bolus only oxytocin
regimen is recommended in the United
Kingdom.58French guidelines recom-
mend a oxytocin bolus plus infusionregimen during CD  however  suggest aninitial bolus dose of 5 e10 IU.
59
Strengths and limitations
We used a systematic and methodologi-cally robust approach to searching and
analyzing literature without date or
language restrictions. We included bothrandomized and nonrandomizedstudies  which allowed for a more thor-ough and nuanced investigation ofoxytocin dosing regimens. We also pre-speciﬁed outcomes that aligned with
WHO priority outcomes
4and the PPH
core outcome set11and used the latest
and more sophisticated iterations of theCochrane risk of bias tools (ROB 2.0 andROBINS-I).
14 15
Despite this  evidence was generally
limited for most outcomes. In a networkmeta-analysis by Gallos et al
5in which
different uterotonic options werecompared  the authors similarly
described inadequate reporting ofadverse events in trials of uterotonics forPPH prevention.
5The international
consensus statement by Heesen et al8
also called for further large studies onthis topic.
8Any such trials should be
sufﬁciently powered for important
health-related outcomes and should
clearly specify the dosing regimen. Spe-ciﬁcally  trials comparing different
oxytocin doses of bolus plus infusionregimens should be conducted. Weconsider it particularly important thatfuture trials should report on theoutcome of PPH /C211000 mL  an impor-
tant outcome for clinical guideline de-
cision making.
We also found hypotension to be a
poorly studied outcome  despite dose-dependent hypotension being welldescribed.
21 29 42 46 62Among RCTs  the
effects of different dosing regimens onhypotension were generally either
inconclusive or equivocal. No NRSI re-
ported signi ﬁcant differences in the
incidence of hypotension. However  itwould not seem unreasonable to expectan increased incidence of hypotensionwith higher doses (particularly withbolus regimens)  and it is likely that thecombination of a bolus plus infusion
regimen allows doses to exceed 5 IU
while avoiding signi ﬁcant hemodynamic
instability. Indeed  we consider itparticularly important to prioritizeresearch in this area.
We also did not ﬁnd any clear evidence
of diminishing returns from increasingdoses and/or longer time periods of
infusion despite it also being well
described.
22 26Again  this was largely
because of lack of good-quality data andis an area for which further research isrequired.
We identi ﬁed a wide range of dosing
regimens that added to the complexity ofthis analysis and likely contributed to
high heterogeneity. Although we aimed
to standardize comparisons by usingtotal oxytocin dose  we were not able toaccount for other factors such as rate ofoxytocin administration or total infu-sion time. We acknowledge that our dosecategories are somewhat arbitrary although necessary to standardize andajog.org Systematic Reviews

###13###interpret comparisons. We also tried to
minimize the effect of subjective judg-ments on blood loss by including this inour risk of bias assessment and per-forming sensitivity analyses.
Finally  the majority of studies
included only women undergoing plan-ned CD with low risk of PPH. Hence 
these ﬁndings may not be generalizable
to other  higher-risk groups of womenwho may require a different oxytocinregimen.
Conclusions and implications
Based on current evidence  the mostappropriate oxytocin regimen may be
bolus plus infusion and an initial bolus
of<5 IU  although further trials are
needed to con ﬁrm these conclusions.
Bolus only regimens of 10 IU vs 5 IU maydecrease the use of additional utero-tonics  however  further research isrequired to understand the implicationson adverse events  particularly hypoten-
sion. In the absence of more robust evi-
dence  many current guidelines on PPHprevention following CD may warrantreconsideration. Further research isrequired  particularly in women at highrisk for PPH  for other important out-comes such as adverse maternal events breastfeeding  and maternal well-being
and satisfaction.
Final conclusion
This systematic review and meta-
analysis of IV oxytocin dosing regimensfor PPH prevention during CDs identi-ﬁed a lack of data for several important
outcomes. Future well-designed studiesare required to identify an optimaloxytocin dosing regimen for womenundergoing CD. Nevertheless  available
data suggest that an IV bolus plus infu-
sion regimen  with an initial bolus doseof<5 IU  may be preferable. However 
the degree of certainty for the evidencewas generally low  and further research isrequired to identify the optimal oxytocinregimen for PPH prevention duringCDs.

Deviations from protocol
Protocol Deviation Justiﬁcation
Primary outcomes: PPH /C21500 mL and PPH /C211000 mL PPH /C21500 mL downgraded from primary outcome to
secondary outcomeWe opted to downgrade PPH /C21500 mL from a primary
to a secondary outcome  considering that the deﬁnitionof PPH after CD is PPH /C211000 mL (as distinct from PPH
after vaginal birth).
Included dyspnea and chest pain as additional
secondary outcomesAdditional adverse events reported in some trials.
Include only third stage administration of oxytocin Included administration of oxytocin at or around third
stagePracticality considerations means oxytocin not always
able to be delivered at third stage during CD.
Random-effects model if I
2>30% Random-effects model for all analyses with >1 trial Given large heterogeneity of trials and as per Cochrane
handbook  random-effects model provided a more
conservative estimate.
Speciﬁc comparisons made between high dose vs low
dose bolus  and high dose vs low dose infusionWe further divided the comparison of studies into (1)
type of IV administration and (2) total oxytocin doseusing the categories of <5 IU  5e9 IU  10e19 IU 
20e49 IU /C2150 IU. Among studies comparing a bolus
plus infusion regimen  we further compared various
initial bolus doses when followed by an infusion.The wide range of oxytocin regimens identiﬁed meant
that our original approach of high and low dose was notpractical nor informative.
GRADE approach used to rate certainty of evidence. More accurately report study ﬁndings and draw
conclusions from the data.

Sensitivity analysis of risk of bias included studies only at overall low risk of bias.
Sensitivity analysis of method of blood loss measurement included studies only at low risk of bias for that domain.Subgroup analysis included only studies using a bolus plus infusion regimen  for which the infusion duration ranged between 2 to 4 hours.GRADE working group grades of evidence were as follows:
High certainty: we are very conﬁdent that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate certainty: we are moderately conﬁdent in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect  but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
Low certainty: our conﬁdence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.Very low certainty: we have very little conﬁdence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of e ffect.
