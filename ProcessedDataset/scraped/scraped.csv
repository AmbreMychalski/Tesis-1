METHODS
The recommendations were developed as a synthesis and update of evidence from the literature. They are based on the FIGO Safe 
Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee (SMNH) guidelines that were published in 20121 and include research and consensus guide-
lines. For the present document a bibliographic review was performed and studies from LMICs and across regions were identified using 
the search engines PubMed Medline Embase Science Direct and Google Scholar. According to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment Development and Evaluation) approach this update does not generate a universal level of evidence. However each section and 
the generated conclusions and recommendations use the degrees of evidence that were identified in the bibliographic review.

1 | EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) 
is actively contributing to the global effort to reduce maternal 
death and disability around the world. Its mission statement re -
flects a commitment to promoting health human rights and well- 
being of all women especially those at the most significant risk of 
death and disability associated with childbearing. FIGO provides 
evidence- based interventions that can reduce the incidence of 
maternal morbidity and mortality when applied with informed 
consent.
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) continues to be the leading 
cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in most countries 
around the world. Despite multiple collaborative efforts at all 
levels there is still a lack of implementation or adherence to 
the recommendations for management of PPH when faced with this obstetric emergency. In part this delay in implementation 
lies in the lack of information from current evidence and a lack 
of unification of the multiple guidelines for diagnosis and strat -
egies to control bleeding. To provide clear and practical tools 
to approach this obstetric emergency especially for low- and 
middle- income countries (LMICs) the FIGO Safe Motherhood 
and Newborn Health Committee (SMNH) supported by a group 
of experts worldwide developed this updated review. It aims to 
provide multiple alternatives for the diagnosis and management 
of PPH tailored to the resources available at the institutional 
local or regional level. This document reflects the best available 
evidence drawn from scientific literature and expert opinion on 
the prevention and treatment of PPH in low- resource settings. 
FIGO believes that the greatest impediment in the adoption of 
a given strategy is the absence of an effective implementation 
tool.

2 | FIGO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF 
POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE
Health workers at all levels of care (particularly in LMICs) need 
to have access to appropriate medications1 and training in PPH 
prevention and management procedures. All attempts should be 
made to reduce PPH using cost- effective resource- appropriate 
interventions. At first all should be done to avoid PPH and re -
duce the need for expensive lifesaving surgical interventions. The 
routine use of active management of the third stage of labor by 
all attendants regardless of where they practice should be rec -
ommended.2 All birth attendants must know how to provide safe 
care (physiologic management) to prevent PPH in the absence of 
uterotonic drugs.3
2.1  |  FIGO recommendations for prevention of 
postpartum hemorrhage
1. The use of uterotonics for prevention of PPH during the third 
stage of labor is recommended for all births.4 5 Oxytocin (10 IU 
intravenously/intramuscularly [IV/IM]) is recommended for the 
prevention of PPH for vaginal delivery and cesarean section.4 5 
In settings where oxytocin is used attention should be paid 
to the oxytocin cold chain.6
2. In settings where oxytocin is unavailable or its quality can-
not be guaranteed the use of other injectable uterotonics (if 
appropriate ergometrine/methylergometrine 200 μg IM/IV; 
hypertensive disorders can be safely excluded prior to its use) 
or oral misoprostol (400–600 µg orally) or carbetocin 100 µg 
IM/IV is recommended for the prevention of PPH.4 5
3. The combinations of ergometrine plus oxytocin or misoprostol plus 
oxytocin may be more effective uterotonic drug strategies for the 
prevention of PPH ≥500 ml compared with the current standard 
oxytocin. This comes at the expense of a higher risk of adverse ef -
fects (vomiting and hypertension with ergometrine and fever with 
misoprostol).7
4. In settings where skilled birth attendants are not present to ad -
minister injectable uterotonics and oxytocin is unavailable the 
administration of misoprostol (400– 600 μ g orally) by community 
healthcare workers and lay health workers is recommended for 
the prevention of PPH.4 5
5. In settings where skilled birth attendants are unavailable con -
trolled cord traction (CCT) is not recommended.4
6. Sustained uterine massage is not recommended as an interven -
tion to prevent PPH in women who have received prophylactic 
oxytocin.8
7. Postpartum abdominal uterine tonus assessment for early identi -
fication of uterine atony is recommended for all women.4
8. Oxytocin (IV or IM) and CCT is the recommended method for removal 
of the placenta for the prevention of PPH in cesarean delivery.42.2  |  FIGO recommendations for treatment of 
postpartum hemorrhage
 1. Intravenous oxytocin alone is the recommended first- line 
uterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH.3 4
 2. If intravenous oxytocin is unavailable or if the bleeding 
does not respond to oxytocin the use of intramuscular er -
gometrine oxytocin– ergometrine fixed dose or a prosta -
glandin drug (including sublingual misoprostol 800 μg) is 
recommended.3 4 9 10
 3. There is no evidence about the safety and efficacy of an additional 
800- μg dose of misoprostol for treatment of PPH when given to 
women who have already received 600 μg of prophylactic misopros -
tol orally.
 4. The use of isotonic crystalloids is recommended in preference to 
the use of colloids for the initial intravenous fluid resuscitation 
of women with PPH.4 11
 5. Early use of intravenous tranexamic acid as soon as PPH is diag -
nosed but within 3 h of birth in addition to standard care is rec -
ommended for women with clinically diagnosed PPH following 
vaginal birth or cesarean delivery.12– 14
 6. Administration of 1 g (100 mg/ml) tranexamic acid intravenously at 
1 ml/min (i.e. administered over 10 min) with a second dose of 1 g in -
travenously if bleeding continues after 30 min or if bleeding restarts 
within 24 h of completing the first dose. Reducing maternal deaths 
due to bleeding through scaling up of tranexamic acid for PPH treat -
ment could have a positive impact on health equity and improve out -
comes among disadvantaged women especially in LMICs.15
 7. Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH.3 4
 8. The use of bimanual uterine compression or external aortic 
compression for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after 
vaginal birth is recommended as a temporizing measure until ap -
propriate care is available.3 4
 9. If women do not respond to treatment using uterotonics or 
if uterotonics are unavailable the use of uterine balloon tam -
ponade is recommended as an effective nonsurgical technique 
that can potentially improve survival in women with PPH due to 
uterine atony after ruling out retained products of conception 
or uterine rupture as a contributing factor.3 4 16
 10. Use of the nonpneumatic antishock garment is recommended 
as a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available.3 4
 11. The use of uterine packing is not recommended for the treat -
ment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth.3 4
 12. Uterine artery embolization can be another conservative man -
agement measure for PPH if technical conditions and skilled 
human resources are available for its use.17
 13. If bleeding does not stop despite treatment using uterotonics 
and other available conservative interventions (e.g. uterine mas -
sage balloon tamponade) the use of surgical interventions is 
recommended.3 4 Surgical interventions include the use of com -
pression suture techniques 18 uterine and hypogastric artery li -
gation and hysterectomy.

 14. The priority is to stop the bleeding before the patient develops 
coagulation problems and organ damage from under- perfusion. 
Conservative approaches should be tried first rapidly moving to 
more invasive procedures if these do not work.

3 |  BACKGROUND
3.1  |  Introduction
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is an obstetric emergency complicat -
ing 1%– 10% of all deliveries.1 It continues to be the leading obstetric 
cause of maternal death.1 In 2015 it was reported to be responsible 
for more than 80 000 maternal deaths worldwide.1 Its distribution 
varies across regions with the highest prevalence of 5.1%– 25.7% 
reported in Africa followed by North America at 4.3%– 13% and Asia 
at 1.9%– 8%.2 The incidence of PPH has also been on the rise 2– 5 in-
creasing from 5.1%– 6.2% in Canada between 2003 and 2010 3 and 
from 2.9%– 3.2% in the USA between 2010 and 2014.4
3.2  |  Past FIGO recommendations for PPH
FIGO has made several recommendations in the past 20 years for 
the management and treatment of PPH (Table 1). This document will 
update the recommendations and discuss new approaches.
3.3  |  Definition of postpartum hemorrhage
The lack of consistency in the definition of PPH has been a major 
limitation to the ability to compare prevalence in different stud -
ies (Table 2). Classically it was defined as quantified bleeding of 
more than 500 ml for vaginal deliveries and more than 1000 ml 
for cesarean deliveries occurring within the first 24 h of delivery.1 However this definition did not focus on clinical signs and symp -
toms of hemorrhage and thus prevented early detection in many 
cases. Therefore in 2017 the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists (ACOG) changed the definition to blood loss of 
more than or equal to 1000 ml or blood loss that was accompanied 
by signs or symptoms of hypovolemia occurring within 24 h after 
birth regardless of the mode of delivery.6 In contrast the Royal 
College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) defines PPH 
according to the volume of blood lost: minor (between 500 and 
1000 ml) and major ( >1000 ml).7 However the volume of estimated 
blood loss remains unreliable in many cases and therefore much 
attention should be directed to the general clinical status of the 
patient instead.8 Several tools for assessment of blood loss have 
been used as accurate estimation will directly influence the diag -
nosis and management of PPH. Many groups cite visual estimation 
as part of blood loss assessment but as it has high potential to un -
derestimate hemorrhage use of additional tools for more objective 
estimation such as gravimetric measurement direct blood collec -
tion techniques and evaluation of clinical parameters have been 
proposed.9– 17 Recently some guidelines have incorporated the 
shock index9 11 14 17 and obstetric early warning systems into their 
recommendations to evaluate bleeding.11 14 17
3.4  |  Etiologies/risk factors
While there exist several identifiable risk factors for PPH most 
cases occur unexpectedly.6 18 An easy way to remember the most 
common etiologies is to remember the four T’s19:

1. Tone: uterine atony (accounts for 70% of PPH cases).20
2. Trauma: genital tract trauma.
3. Tissue: retained products of conception.
4. Thrombin: coagulopathy.
Uterine atony can be anticipated after prolonged labor partic -
ularly with the use of oxytocin in pregnancies complicated with 
chorioamnionitis high parity general anesthesia and other factors 
that lead to uterine overdistension such as multiple fetal gesta -
tion polyhydramnios and fetal macrosomia.6 20 Trauma accounts 
for 15%– 20% of cases 21 and is mostly attributed to perineal or 
cervical lacerations perineal hematomas episiotomies or uterine 
rupture.6 20 These occur in the setting of precipitous uncontrolled 
deliveries or operative vaginal deliveries.6 Retained products of 
conception can increase the risk of PPH by 3.5 times.22 Risk fac -
tors include succenturiate placenta and previous instrumenta -
tion.6 Coagulation problems can be divided into inherited such 
as von Willebrand diseases hemophilia and idiopathic thrombo -
cytopenic purpura and acquired such as the use of anticoagu -

4 | POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE BUNDLE 
CARE
Multimodal strategies have been implemented in high- income coun -
tries to control pathologies with high mortality rates such as PPH. 
These initiatives that involve multiple intervention points and actors 
have been called “bundles” or intervention packages which consist 
of the implementation of a group of interventions as well as multi -
disciplinary programs that standardize and comprehensively address 
the management of pathologies.1– 6 Bundles represent a selection of 
existing guidelines and recommendations in a form that aids system -
atic implementation and a consistency of practice.
The California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) 
Working Group on obstetrical hemorrhage developed the Improving 
the Health Care Response to Obstetric Bleeding Toolkit in 2010 
to help obstetric providers clinical staff hospitals and healthcare organizations develop methods within their facility for timely rec -
ognition and an organized and rapid response to bleeding. In March 
2015 version 2.0 was updated with the latest evidence- based 
changes.6
In 2015 work groups of the National Partnership for Maternal 
Safety — within the Council on Patient Safety in Women's Health 
Care that represents all major women's healthcare professional or -
ganizations in the USA — developed an obstetric hemorrhage safety 
bundle. The goal of the partnership was the adoption of the safety 
bundle by every birthing facility. This consensus bundle is organized 
into four action domains: readiness; recognition and prevention; re-
sponse; and reporting and systems learning. There are 13 key ele -
ments within these four action domains (Table 3).
In 2017 the World Health Organization (WHO) carried out a 
technical consultation among international maternal health experts 
to evaluate the development of care bundles for PPH. A total of 730 
TABLE 3  Obstetric hemorrhage safety bundle action domains from the National Partnership for Maternal Safety Council on Patient 
Safety in Women's Healtha

Readiness (Every Unit) 1. Hemorrhage cart with supplies checklist and instruction cards for uterine balloon tamponade 
and compression sutures.
2. Immediate access to hemorrhage medications (kit or equivalent).
3. A response team to call when help is needed (blood bank advanced gynecologic surgery other 
support and tertiary services).
4. Massive and emergency- release transfusion protocols (type- O negative or uncross- matched).
5. Unit education on protocols unit- based drills (with post drill debriefs).
Recognition and Prevention (Every Patient) 1. Assessment of hemorrhage risk (prenatal on admission and at other appropriate times).
2. Measurement of cumulative blood loss (formal and as quantitative as possible).
3. Active management of the third stage of labor (department- wide protocol).
Response (Every Hemorrhage) 1. Uni- standard stage- based obstetric hemorrhage emergency management plan with checklists.
2. Support program for patients families and staff for all significant hemorrhages.
Reporting and Systems Learning (Every 
Unit)1. Establish a culture of huddles for high- risk patients and post- event debriefs to identify successes 
and opportunities.
2. Multidisciplinary review of serious hemorrhages for systems issues.
3. Outcomes monitoring and process metrics in perinatal quality improvement committee.

articles were reviewed and 430 were used for the construction of 
the theoretical framework of the process. The consultation led to 
a definition of two care bundles which are summarized in Table 4.
The first response PPH bundle must be implemented at both the 
primary healthcare and hospital levels. The discussion about the re -
sponse to refractory PPH bundle raised some controversy. For the 
first response PPH bundle the next phase is the development of 
an implementation strategy culminating in a model for use at the 
facility level in LMICs. For the response to refractory PPH bundle it 
is a priority to solve pending controversies including the operational 
definition of refractory PPH and to better understand the effective -
ness of various uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) devices.REFERENCES

5 | SHOCK INDEX EVIDENCE IN 
POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE EVALUATION 
AND MANAGEMENT
Shock refers to a reduction in tissue perfusion which is insuf -
ficient to meet the metabolic requirements of tissues and organs. 
Insufficient blood flow may be clinically identified as the develop -
ment of one or more of the following: lactic acidosis altered men -
tal status oliguria and tachycardia. Vital signs monitoring is key 
to hemodynamic assessment and prompt intervention.1 In healthy 
pregnant and postpartum women cardiologic physiologic com -
pensatory mechanisms prevent changes in vital signs until a large 
volume of blood has been lost (usually > 1000 ml). Hence changes 
in clinical and vital signs that result from hemorrhage appear late 
in the process and may not lead to early identification of PPH. 
This in turn makes it difficult to establish cutoff points to trigger 
clinical interventions. Moreover because traditional vital signs 
change late and are less reliable as triggers for clinical actions 
other indicators could help to characterize maternal hypovolemia 
caused by bleeding.2 Although the use of conventional individual 
vital signs (pulse and systolic blood pressure) may lack accuracy in 
the assessment of hypotension a simple combination of both may 
transform routine clinical parameters into a more accurate indica -
tor of hypovolemia such as the shock index (SI). SI is defined as 
the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure.3 4 The SI may im -
prove the predictive capability of individual clinical signs which 
aids early identification of women at risk of hypovolemia as the 
result of obstetric causes.5 Moreover the SI has been proposed 
as a reliable indicator of adverse maternal outcomes 6 and its val -
ues have been set to indicate clinical management.7 However the 
association between shock parameters and advanced treatment 
modalities in severe PPH has yet to be reported.
5.1  |  Assessment of circulating blood volume in 
postpartum hemorrhage
The essential cornerstone of management of PPH involves prompt 
diagnosis and rapid replacement of lost blood volume as well as 
the oxygen- carrying capacity of blood accompanied by immediate 
medical and surgical measures to address the underlying cause(s) 
and hence prevent more loss. To assess the patient's condition SI 
has been introduced as a simple and clinically effective vital sign.
The SI has been shown to have an inverse linear relation -
ship with left ventricular stroke work in acute circulatory failure. 
Therefore a concurrent reduction of left ventricular stroke work 
(induced by hemorrhage trauma or sepsis) was associated with an 
elevation of the SI and a deterioration in left ventricular mechanical 
performance. Poor left ventricular function or persistent abnormal 
elevation of the SI after aggressive therapy and hemodynamic sta -
bilization was associated with increased mortality in critically ill 
traumatized patients.8 In obstetric and nonobstetric circumstances 
the absence of a significant drop in blood pressure in patients with PPH may mask the actual hypovolemic status due to physiological 
compensatory mechanisms.9 For that reason the SI was the only 
promising marker that indicated the severity of blood loss.2 5
The SI together with the rule of 30 are important tools that may 
aid clinicians in an emergency to determine the amount of blood loss 
and the degree of hemodynamic instability. Before the fall in systolic 
blood pressure heart rate rises to compensate for the blood loss 
and thus the SI increases. The rule of 30 is an approximated blood 
loss of 30% of normal (70 ml/kg in adults 100 ml/kg throughout 
pregnancy) defined by a fall of 30% in hematocrit a fall of 30% in 
hemoglobin (approximately 3 g/dl) a fall of 30 mm Hg in systolic 
blood pressure and a rise in pulse rate by 30 beats per minute.10 It 
has been shown that an SI ≥0.9 is associated with increased mortal -
ity and an SI >1 increases the likelihood of blood transfusion.11 12 To 
date standard obstetric SI has been defined as 0.7– 0.9 compared 
with 0.5– 0.7 for the nonpregnant population taking into account 
that the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy may delay the recogni -
tion of hypovolemia.5 If intravascular volume depletion is suspected 
a rapid clinical assessment is required because the patient's clinical 
condition can deteriorate leading to the development of hemor -
rhagic shock rapidly. Proper medical record- taking skills may high -
light symptoms associated with shock such as pain and overt blood 
loss as well as general malaise anxiety and dyspnea. Notably in set -
tings where few PPH treatment options exist and in cases of home 
deliveries diagnosis and treatment or referral must occur even ear -
lier than in hospital settings to improve outcomes. For that reason 
SI may be a valuable threshold in LMICs where mortality is highest 
and is often related to delays in complication recognition transpor -
tation and level of care at the facility.2 A threshold of SI ≥0.9 should 
be tested to alert community healthcare providers of the need for 
urgent transfer.13

6 | REVIEW OF GUIDELINES AROUND 
THE WORLD
Guidelines are defined as systematically developed statements 
that assist practitioners to take decisions about appropriate 
health care in specific clinical circumstances.1 Over the past dec -
ades many national and international PPH guidelines have been 
developed and become part of obstetric clinical practice around 
the world. PPH guidelines usually address similar topics (e.g. di -
agnosis prevention and treatment of PPH) but may differ in their 
recommendations.2– 4 These differences are because most of the 
recommendations are based on observational studies clinical 
judgment and expert opinion. There are few randomized con -
trolled trials available to produce strong recommendations for the 
management of PPH due to the emergency of the condition that 
hinders this type of study. In the absence of randomized trials 
guidelines gather the best available evidence. In addition popula -
tion characteristics cultural aspects resources availability as well 
as frequency and timing of updates may influence the guidelines’ 
contents and justify some disparities.1– 4

6.1  |  Guidelines that address the prevention of 
postpartum hemorrhage
Active management of third stage of labor is frequently discussed 
in guidelines.1– 7 There is consensus that all women should receive 
uterotonics after delivery as it has proven to reduce PPH rates. 
Oxytocin has been cited as the drug of choice by most guidelines 
but its dosages and route of administration vary largely especially 
when considering mode of delivery.1– 5 7– 10 In 2012 FIGO established 
recommendations for the prevention of PPH11 and in 2018 WHO 
updated its recommendation for pharmacological PPH prevention 
and reinforced the use of oxytocin (10 IU intramuscularly or intra -
venously) as the drug of choice.12 WHO also recommends the use 
of carbetocin (if cost- effective) ergot alkaloids (alone or combined 
if there are no contraindications) or oral misoprostol in settings 
where oxytocin is not available or its quality cannot be guaranteed. 
Misoprostol is also recommended when the use of other injectable 
uterotonics is not possible due to unavailability or contraindication 
to use such as hypertension in the context of ergometrine.12 13 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) has 
updated its publication and reinforced the use of carbetocin as a 
first- line uterotonic for prevention at cesarean delivery or vaginal 
delivery with one risk factor.6 The German/Austrian/Swiss guideline 
mentions that prophylaxis during cesarean delivery can consist of 
administering either oxytocin or carbetocin.5 Other prophylactic 
strategies have been proposed in guidelines but many had no great 
consensus or no clear benefits.1– 7 Table 5 summarizes various PPH 
prevention strategies described by different societies worldwide.

for prevention of PPH for all births as a first- line 
uterotonic agent.
• If oxytocin is not available or its quality is in doubt other 
options include carbetocin misoprostol or ergot alkaloids.
• Controlled cord traction is recommended for vaginal births 
in settings where skilled birth attendants are available.
• Early cord clamping ( <1 min after birth) is not recommended 
unless the neonate needs immediate resuscitation.
• Postpartum assessment of uterine tonus is recommended 
for all women.

6.2  |  Guidelines that address the treatment of 
postpartum hemorrhage
PPH guidelines frequently recommend a multidisciplinary approach 
for reaching effective early control of bleeding. Treatment should be 
directed to the specific cause of PPH (uterine atony genital trauma 
retained placenta and/or coagulopathy) and therapeutic steps 
should move from the less invasive method to the more complex and 
radical approach. A set of initial measures also seems to be consen -
sual in most guidelines and consist of maintenance of two large IV 
lines supplementation of oxygen strict monitoring of women crys -
talloids infusion and measures to avoid hypothermia and evaluate 
the PPH cause.1– 9
If atony is the etiology most guidelines suggest perform -
ing temporary mechanical measures such as uterine massage 
or uterine bimanual compression with concurrent pharmaco -
logical treatment.1– 10 Uterotonics are considered the first- line 
treatment for uterine atony. Intravenous oxytocin is usually the 
preferred drug and route of administration but its dosage varies 
widely. When oxytocin fails to control PPH guidelines recom -
mend the use of an additional drug such as ergot alkaloids in -
jectable prostaglandins or misoprostol.1– 4 6– 8 10 SOGC mentions 
carbetocin as a uterotonic available for treatment 5 and the 
German/Austrian/Swiss guidelines highlight that the use of car -
betocin to treat PPH is currently not sufficiently investigated4 
(Table 6).
Since publication of the World Maternal Antifibrolytic (WOMAN) 
trial 11 tranexamic acid (TXA) an antifibrinolytic drug has been in -
corporated into PPH guidelines around the world.4 6– 10 12 13 WHO 
has updated this topic and recommends the use of TXA as soon as 
possible within the first 3 h from birth at a dose of 1 g intravenously 
regardless of the route of birth.12 13 However some guidelines do 
not cite it5 or do not add it in a definitive manner because their last 
update occurred before the WOMAN trial results.1 2 Another drug 
that has been discussed in many guidelines is recombinant activated 
factor VII for massive PPH; however there is no consensus about 
its use.1– 6
When pharmacological treatment fails in controlling hemor -
rhage guidelines usually recommend some mechanical radiologi -
cal and more conservative surgical approaches before performing 
hysterectomy. The available guidelines are summarized in Table 6. The most cited ones are uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) uterine 
compressive sutures (UCS) pelvic vascular ligation (PVL) and embo -
lization.1– 7 10 Uterine packing with gauze is also mentioned in some 
guidelines but its use is controversial.3 5 ACOG mentions the use of 
a gauze soaked with thrombin.6
German/Austrian/Swiss guidelines cite the use of intrauter -
ine packing with a gauze coated with a hemostatic agent.4 Due 
to the lack of evidence guidelines do not necessarily recommend 
these conservative approaches in a well- defined step- wise pro -
gression and their utilization depends mainly on the availability 
of resources professional familiarity with technique and clinical 
circumstances.10
UBT is typically indicated as the treatment of choice when uter -
ine atony is refractory to uterotonics after vaginal delivery as it is 
less invasive than the other procedures.1– 3 6– 9 This should be con -
sidered after ruling out retained products of conception ruptured 
uterus or vaginal or cervical laceration as a contributing factor. If 
UBT fails to control bleeding in these cases invasive treatments by 
arterial embolization or most commonly by surgical approaches are 
recommended (Table 7). UCS and/or PVL are recommended to avoid 
hysterectomy when laparotomy is performed. The most mentioned 
UCS techniques in guidelines are B- Lynch Hayman and/or Cho su -
tures while the most cited PVL techniques are bilateral uterine and/
or utero- ovarian vessel ligations and less frequently hypogastric 
ligature.1– 10 PVL and UCS can also be used together.
Embolization is also cited as a conservative therapeutic strat -
egy; however it is most often indicated in places where spe -
cialized equipment and professionals are available in a timely 
manner.1– 5 7 10 Therefore these conditions may limit its use in 
acute bleedings.
If bleeding is severe especially in low- resource settings some 
guidelines recommend the use of temporizing measures such as 
aortic compression and more recently the nonpneumatic antishock 
garment (NASG) to reduce blood loss until appropriate care is avail -
able or while awaiting transfer to a higher- level facility.3 7 14 15 NASG 
has been recommended by WHO and FIGO for postpartum women 
with severe hemorrhage showing signs of shock or hemodynamic 
instability at all levels of care especially at the primary healthcare 
level or if transport to a higher facility is necessary.3 14 15
Regarding hysterectomy it is usually recommended when other 
procedures have failed to control massive bleeding or when they 
were not indicated. Guidelines highlight that hysterectomy should 
be performed “sooner rather than later ” before the patient devel -
ops coagulopathy.1– 7 9 10 Recently damage control surgery (intra- 
abdominal or pelvic packing) has been mentioned in some PPH 
guidelines as an approach for critically ill patients with persistent 
bleeding after hysterectomy.4 7
Finally many guidelines also address statements for the manage -
ment of genital tract trauma (especially uterine inversion and uterine 
rupture) coagulopathy disorders and retained placenta in obstetric 
patients. Because of the high maternal morbidity and mortality re -
lated to the placenta accreta spectrum and its relation to the high 
rates of cesarean deliveries in many countries around the world

7 | MEDICAL PREVENTION AND 
TREATMENT
7.1  |  Carbetocin versus oxytocin use in PPH: recent 
evidence
Oxytocin has been traditionally used as the first- line uterotonic for 
the prevention of PPH. Since 1992 carbetocin has been extensively 
tested in the management of PPH.1 2 Beyond its uterotonic effects 
carbetocin may also promote blood coagulation.3
7.1.1  |  Clinical evidence for PPH prevention: 
oxytocin versus carbetocin (vaginal delivery)
The Heat- Stable Carbetocin versus Oxytocin to Prevent 
Hemorrhage after Vaginal Birth (CHAMPION) study provided 
new evidence comparing oxytocin and carbetocin.4 It studied 
29 645 women with cervical dilation < 6 cm having a singleton 
pregnancy and planned for vaginal delivery. Patients were rand -
omized to receive intramuscular injection of 100 µg heat- stable 
carbetocin (Paban) or 10 IU oxytocin in 10 different countries. 
The data showed that for PPH prevention heat- stable carbetocin 
was not inferior to oxytocin administration for blood loss of at 
least 500 ml (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.95– 1.06) or the use of additional 
uterotonic agents. Noninferiority was not shown for the outcome 
of blood loss of at least 1000 ml (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.87– 1.25). In 
this study when the two drugs were compared the following re -
sults were obtained: in women with > 500 ml blood loss additional 
uterotonic agents were required in almost 15% of cases in both 
arms. When blood loss exceeded 1000 ml the requirement for 
additional uterotonics was only 1.5% in both arms.3 Therefore ac -
cess to drugs is key since oxytocin has problems with drug purity 
in low- resource settings. The safety profile appeared to be similar 
for both drugs.
More recently a network meta- analysis including 140 random -
ized trials with data from 88 947 women was developed to identify 
the most effective uterotonic drug(s) to prevent PPH and generate 
a ranking according to their effectiveness and adverse effect pro -
file.5 The data showed that compared with oxytocin the combina -
tion of ergometrine plus oxytocin had a risk ratio of 0.69 (95% CI 
0.57– 0.83) and was more effective; however with only moderate 
quality evidence and with higher risk of adverse effects such as 
vomiting and hypertension. For carbetocin the risk ratio was 0.72 
(95% CI 0.52– 1.00) and although it was significant there was very 
low- quality evidence. Finally for misoprostol plus oxytocin the risk 
ratio was 0.73 (95% CI 0.60– 0.90) with moderate quality evidence 
and higher risk of fever.5 In a low- risk setting there may be advan -
tages to using well- tested and readily available drugs. When the 
carbetocin effect was compared with the use of rectal misoprostol 
for preventing PPH in low- risk patient populations in a random -
ized controlled trial among 150 pregnant women the data showed the superiority of carbetocin for efficacy.6 This was evidenced in 
all indices tested; beyond blood loss patients had a shorter third 
stage of labor and reduced need for additional uterotonic drugs. 
Additionally adverse effects such as diarrhea shivering and fever 
were more pronounced with misoprostol administration.6 In a ran -
domized controlled trial of patients with severe pre- eclampsia car -
betocin was shown to be a good alternative to oxytocin requiring 
a lower volume per dose.7
7.1.2  |  Clinical evidence for PPH prevention: 
oxytocin versus carbetocin (cesarean delivery)
Cesarean delivery is a surgical procedure requiring high skill oper -
ating time anesthesia intravenous fluids and different drugs. The 
addition of carbetocin therefore is expected to be of benefit and 
the need for a single drug administration reduces the need for an 
intensive management team which is generally required following a 
cesarean delivery. A Cochrane review including 11 studies showed 
that despite a statistically significant reduction in the need for fur -
ther uterotonics in the carbetocin group compared with oxytocin in 
women undergoing a cesarean delivery no statistically significant 
differences in terms of the risk of PPH were noted.8 In 2018 a meta- 
analysis to analyze the effectiveness of carbetocin compared with 
oxytocin for the prevention of PPH in cesarean deliveries (seven 
studies involving 2012 patients) demonstrated a significant reduc -
tion in the rates of PPH (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66– 0.94 P = 0.009) use 
of additional uterotonics (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.49– 0.65 P < 0.001) 
and transfusion (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.15– 0.64 P = 0.002) when carbe -
tocin was used instead of oxytocin. However despite the potential 
benefits the disparity between the cost of carbetocin and oxytocin 
suggests that a locoregional cost- effectiveness analysis should be 
performed before making the decision to adopt carbetocin for rou -
tine prophylaxis.9
In 2020 sequential trial analysis of five randomized controlled 
trials of studies with data on women (a total of 1214) undergoing 
nonelective cesarean deliveries where carbetocin was compared 
with oxytocin was performed.10 The need for additional uteroton -
ics was reduced with carbetocin compared with oxytocin (OR 0.30; 
95% CI 0.11– 0.86; I2 90.60%). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) con -
firmed that the information size needed to show a significant re -
duction in the need for additional uterotonics had been exceeded. 
No significant differences were shown with respect to any of the 
secondary outcomes but there was significant heterogeneity be -
tween the studies. The authors concluded that further trials utiliz -
ing consistent core outcomes are needed to determine an effect 
on PPH.10
On the other hand a single center study was carried out to 
evaluate the cost- effectiveness of carbetocin compared with oxy -
tocin when used for prophylaxis against PPH. With approximately 
3000 cesarean deliveries per year the study showed that the use 
of carbetocin could prevent 108 episodes of PPH 104 episodes

of transfusion and 455 patients would require fewer uteroton -
ics. Their cost- saving per PPH case was USD$ 278.70.11 Another 
study where 1500 cesarean deliveries (both elective and emer -
gency) were analyzed over 12 months carbetocin use as opposed 
to oxytocin use reduced 30 (88 vs 58) PPH events ( >500 ml blood 
loss) and saved £27 518. Carbetocin had a 91.5% better outcome 
and was 69.4% cheaper.12 When compared with the need for ad -
ditional uterotonics in the carbetocin group none required addi -
tional medication versus 71.5% in the oxytocin group ( P < 0.01). 
In another prospective cohort study carbetocin used for 400 
patients undergoing cesarean delivery led to reduced PPH and 
the use of other oxytocic agents saving £68.93 per patient.13 In 
2019 a systematic review of the cost- effectiveness of uterotonic 
agents for the prevention of PPH was published with 15 studies 
across all income categories that compared misoprostol versus no 
uterotonic (five studies) or versus oxytocin (one study) carbeto -
cin versus oxytocin (eight studies) and one study comparing nu -
merous uterotonics.14 The evidence on the cost- effectiveness of 
various uterotonic agents was not generalizable to different con -
texts. In the absence of reliable evidence the choice of uterotonic 
will likely be highly influenced by uterotonic price and contextual 
factors. In the context of cesarean delivery carbetocin was more 
cost favorable than oxytocin. The authors concluded the quality 
of the evidence provided by these studies has a lack of sensitivity 
analyzes and incomplete description of the methods of outcome 
and costs measurements in most studies. In addition some studies 
from middle- income countries favoring carbetocin were funded by 
the manufacturer. They interpreted findings from these studies 
and those of the conference abstracts with limited data cautiously 
owing to the potential risk of bias and imprecision. Therefore it 
can be easily inferred that the relative cost- effectiveness of car -
betocin is still inconclusive.
Beyond its primary efficacy which is reduced blood loss a 
drug's safety profile must also be considered before wide- scale 
utilization. The adverse effects of carbetocin and oxytocin were 
examined in a small randomized study.15 The data showed that car -
betocin had a lower rate of nausea. In contrast with other clinical 
indices including the need to stabilize systolic blood pressure and 
heart rate no other differences were noted.15 Since anesthesiolo -
gists administer carbetocin for cesarean delivery the requirement 
for increased dose beyond the standard 100 ug in some instances 
was raised.16 The longer half- life of carbetocin prevents additional 
dosing in case of a persistent bleed and does not permit additional 
oxytocin administration. The increase in carbetocin dose from 
100 µg to 140 µ g injection increases cardiovascular complications.17 
Thus in cases of pre- eclampsia close attention is warranted for 
preserving patient safety before high dose carbetocin is adminis -
tered. Also in those cases oxytocin doses must be increased to 
control bleeding beyond the standard treatment mainly if the drug 
was used during labor which may also increase complications rate. 
A case report showed that carbetocin administration for a patient 
with asthma led to nearly fatal bronchospasm and cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation which was successful.18 Therefore this 
drug should be used with caution in patients with asthma or those 
with advanced pulmonary pathology. This and other studies show 
inconsistency in adverse events data and indicate that the utility 
of carbetocin should be further assessed in additional pregnancy 
pathologies to establish the population in which the risk– benefit 
profile is favorable.

regarding oxytocin as the first choice for prevention 
of PPH in vaginal and cesarean deliveries.
In settings where oxytocin is unavailable (or its quality can -
not be guaranteed) the use of other uterotonics (carbe -

8 | TRANEXAMIC ACID
Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic analogue of the amino acid 
lysine that inhibits fibrinolysis by reducing the binding of plasmi -
nogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to fibrin.1 Labeled 
indications of this medication are cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding 
and oral procedures in patients with hemophilia. An antifibrinolytic 
drug is useful because hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion 
are common in the early stages of major postpartum bleeding and 
although existing medical and surgical interventions can be used to 
treat postpartum bleeding TXA offers an alternative way to sup -
port hemostasis.
8.1  |  Administration of TXA
1. Administration of TXA is recommended as soon as the di -
agnosis of PPH is made if the diagnosis is made within 3 h 
of delivery . When more than 3 h has elapsed since delivery 
there is no clear evidence of benefit from TXA administration. 
TXA for PPH treatment is given 1 g IV over 10 min within 
3 h of vaginal or cesarean delivery. One gram (10 ml of a 
100 mg/ml solution) is infused over 10– 20 min because infu -
sion >1 ml/min can cause hypotension. If bleeding continues 
after 30 min or stops and restarts within 24 h after the first 
dose a second dose of 1 g may be given. The antifibrinolytic 
effect lasts up to 7– 8 h in the serum. The concentration in 
breast milk is approximately one hundredth of the serum peak 
concentration so it is unlikely to have antifibrinolytic effects 
in the infant.2 3 The WOMAN trial found that administration 
of TXA within 3 h of delivery to women with established 
PPH decreases maternal mortality secondary to bleeding and 
reduces the need for laparotomy to control hemorrhage.2
2. TXA as a management strategy in addition to uterotonics re -
duced the risk of PPH in randomized trials . Its use is effective 
in high- risk clinical settings (e.g. delivery of patients who refuse 
blood products patients with a significant risk for PPH such as 
placenta accreta or placenta previa or previous PPH). Usually 
1 g TXA intravenously is recommended within 10 min after vag -
inal delivery in addition to oxytocin cord traction and uterine 
massage.4 5 A Cochrane review of antifibrinolytic agents used 
for the treatment for PPH identified three eligible trials two 
of which compared intravenous TXA with placebo or standard 
care (the WOMAN trial and a French trial).4 6 A meta- analysis 
of 20 172 women from the WOMAN trial and the French trial 
(152 women with PPH received high- dose TXA a loading dose 
of 4 g over 1 h followed by an infusion of 1 g over 6 h) showed 
that TXA reduces the risk of death due to bleeding (RR 0.81; 
95% CI 0.65– 1.00) with early treatment being more effective. 
WHO updated its recommendation on the early use of TXA for 
the treatment of PPH (within 3 h of birth) with intravenous TXA 
using the same dosing regimen as in the WOMAN trial: a fixed 
dose of 1 g in 10 ml (100 mg/ml) intravenously at a rate of 1 ml/min. A second 1 g intravenous dose should be administered if 
bleeding continues after 30 min or restarts within 24 h of the 
first dose.
3. TXA should be given to all women with clinically estimated blood 
loss of more than 500 ml after vaginal birth or 1000 ml after ce -
sarean delivery or any blood loss that is sufficient to compromise 
hemodynamic stability regardless of the cause of hemorrhage . 
TXA forms a reversible complex that displaces plasminogen from 
fibrin resulting in inhibition of fibrinolysis and inhibition of the 
proteolytic activity of plasmin. TXA is recommended for PPH 
management. It is given concomitantly with other drugs and pro -
cedures for control of bleeding. An antifibrinolytic drug is useful 
because hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion are common 
in the early stages of major postpartum bleeding. Delay in treat -
ment even if short reduces the benefit of TXA administration. 
The WOMAN trial found that TXA reduced death due to bleeding 
in women with PPH by 20%– 30% and was not associated with 
an increase in adverse effects. It also reduced the incidence of 
laparotomy to control bleeding by 36% but did not reduce hys -
terectomy rates. However the decision to perform hysterectomy 
was sometimes made at the same time as randomization so some 
hysterectomies were performed before or concurrently with ad -
ministration of TXA.2 3
8.2  |  TXA as a prophylactic measure
Although the WOMAN trial presents evidence for the use of 
TXA to treat established PPH there is limited evidence for its 
role in prevention of PPH. Reviews and meta- analyses of multi -
ple trials have shown that prophylactic use of TXA may decrease 
both postpartum bleeding and the need for blood transfusions.7 8 
However larger adequately powered multicenter randomized 
controlled trials are needed before the prophylactic use of TXA 
can be recommended for the prevention of PPH. In 2021 a mul -
ticenter double- blind randomized controlled trial was conducted 
with 4551 women undergoing cesarean delivery before or during 
labor at 34 or more gestational weeks who received an intrave -
nously administered prophylactic uterotonic agent and either TXA 
(1 g) or placebo. Among women who underwent cesarean delivery 
and received prophylactic uterotonic agents TXA treatment re-
sulted in a significantly lower incidence of calculated estimated 
blood loss greater than 1000 ml or red- cell transfusion by day 2 
compared with placebo but it did not result in a lower incidence 
of hemorrhage- related secondary clinical outcomes.9 Several sys -
tematic reviews related to the treatment of PPH exist. Mousa 
et al.10 conducted a review that sought to include studies examin -
ing the effectiveness of all types of treatments for PPH. However 
their review primarily included studies involving treatment with 
misoprostol and little evidence regarding TXA. They concluded 
that more research was needed regarding the effectiveness of 
TXA for treatment of PPH.10 Additionally the existing systematic 
reviews that examined TXA for prophylaxis against PPH (where

ESCOBAR Et Al.
all laboring patients receive TXA) did not address the potential 
effects of administering TXA only to mothers with PPH.11 FIGO 
does not recommend the use of TXA prophylactically given the 
limited evidence in that regard.
8.3  |  Adverse reactions to TXA
1. Greater than 10%: headache (oral: 50%) abdominal pain (oral: 
20%) back pain (oral: 21%) musculoskeletal pain (oral: 11%) 
nasal signs and symptoms (oral: 25%; including sinus symptoms).
2. 1%– 10%: fatigue (oral: 5%) anemia (oral: 6%) arthralgia (oral: 7%) 
muscle cramps (oral: ≤7%) muscle spasm (oral: ≤7%).
3. Less than 1%: allergic dermatitis allergic skin reaction anaphylac -
tic shock anaphylactoid reaction anaphylaxis cerebral thrombo -
sis chromatopsia conjunctivitis (ligneous) deep vein thrombosis 
diarrhea dizziness hypersensitivity reaction hypotension (with 
rapid intravenous injection) nausea pulmonary embolism renal 
cortical necrosis retinal artery occlusion retinal vein occlusion 
seizure ureteral obstruction visual disturbance vomiting.
8.4  |  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to TXA or any component of the formulation.
8.5  |  Implementation of treatment with TXA
1. TXA should always be readily available in obstetric care fa -
cilities. It is cost- effective heat stable and widely available 
with a long shelf life. An economic evaluation that used data 
from the WOMAN trial to assess the cost- effectiveness of 
early TXA for usual care of women with PPH in Nigeria and 
Pakistan concluded that it is likely to be highly cost- effective.4
2. TXA should be used in addition to all usual treatments for the 
management of PPH including medical (uterotonics) nonsurgical 
and surgical interventions.2 3
3. It has a wide therapeutic index and a further intravenous in -
jection could be given when this becomes possible. Alternative 
routes of administration should be a research priority as recom -
mended by WHO.12
4. Owing to improvements in emergency obstetric care including 
use of TXA as a first- line therapy more women will survive PPH 
than ever before. Furthermore the incidence of PPH is increas -
ing 1 and consequently the number of women who will experience 
its physical and psychological consequences will also increase. More research is needed on how to reduce the risk factors for 
PPH.

9 | NONSURGICAL CONSERVATIVE 
MANAGEMENT
9.1  |  Nonpneumatic antishock garment (NASG)
The NASG is a low- technology affordable first- aid compres -
sion device for the management and stabilization of women with 
hypovolemic shock due to PPH and management of refractory 
PPH.1 This device serves as a temporizing measure to recover 
hemodynamic stability to allow definitive surgical interventions 
blood transfusions or transfer to more specialized healthcare 
facilities.2– 4
The NASG is a lightweight lower body compression device com -
prising six articulated neoprene and hook- and- loop fastener seg -
ments that provide lower body circumferential counterpressure to 
improve cardiac output and blood pressure.5
The estimated circumferential pressure applied by the NASG is 
around 20– 40 mm Hg. Direct abdominal and pelvic compression 
reduces the total vascular space in the lower body and decreases 
pelvic perfusion to pelvic compartment organs and smaller pelvic 
blood vessels promoting hemorrhage arrest.6 Additionally the pres -
sure applied increases cardiac output and the central circulation al -
lowing an increased distribution of blood flow to vital upper body 
organs (heart lung brains) and contributing to a rapid recovery from 
shock.1 7
Likewise the direct compression of the descending aorta re -
duces bleeding from the uterine arteries and the mesenteric bed's 
vasculature perhaps decreasing up to 90% of blood flow at the level 
of the superior mesenteric artery.1 8
A further property of the NASG that makes it useful for maternal 
hemorrhage is the easy access to the vagina and perineum thereby 
facilitating genital medical and surgical interventions. Additionally 
it is extremely cost- effective even for very low- resource settings 
and is reusable as it can be disinfected and washed over 100 times 
without losing its compressive effects.3 It is also adjustable for many 
women of different girths and heights.
9.1.1  |  Safety
According to human studies the NASG is a safe device with no ad -
verse effects such as abdominal wall lesions or other types of po -
tential injuries secondary to the circumferential pressure applied 
independent of the patient's body mass index or the strength used 
to close each of the segments of the garment.2 In multiple studies 
there were no adverse events associated with NASG use: no in -
creased rates of dyspnea cardiac or renal dysfunctions. In fact in 
all studies of NASG involving extremely ill women with severe PPH 
there were decreased rates of all severe maternal morbidities.4
Doppler studies of the distal aorta when the NASG is applied 
have shown a drop in the flow rate (volume/time) up to 33%. 
Additionally when the garment's abdominal and pelvic segments are placed the resistive index (inversely proportional to flow rate) of the 
internal iliac arteries increases.7
9.1.2  |  Effectiveness and advantages
Multiple studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy and ef -
fectiveness of the NASG. Observational quasi- experimental studies 
at referral centers in Egypt Nigeria India Zambia and Zimbabwe 
showed a 48% drop in maternal mortality related to hypovolemic 
shock (secondary to PPH).2 Overall the groups that received NASG 
treatment required fewer transfers to higher complexity facilities 
as well as abdominal hysterectomies (for definitive therapeutic ap -
proach) than women in the control groups with a relative risk of 0.44 
(95% CI 0.23– 0.86).9
A randomized controlled trial implemented in Zambia and 
Zimbabwe demonstrated that early placement of the NASG at pri -
mary healthcare centers was associated with a statistically signifi -
cant decline in shock recovery time (defined as shock index < 0.9) 
with a median time to recovery of 170 min for the NASG group ver -
sus 209 min for the control group with a hazard ratio of 1.2 (95% CI 
1.02– 1.52 P = 0.03). Although the reduction in mortality and severe 
maternal morbidities (54%) in this study was not statistically signif -
icant (perhaps due to much smaller sample size than was necessary 
to show statistical significance) it is still significant considering the 
seriousness of the outcomes.10
In 2015 a systematic review of quasi- experimental studies and 
the trial above compared PPH standard care versus standard care 
plus NASG. It found that the use of the NASG combined with stan -
dard PPH care reduces both maternal mortality (48%) with a relative 
risk of 0.52 (95% CI 0.36– 0.77) and a 68% reduction in combined 
adverse outcomes mortality and severe morbidities (RR 0.31; 95% 
CI 0.17– 0.59). Furthermore safety was demonstrated by the ab -
sence of differences in adverse events among groups.2
Effectiveness outside of clinical trials has been reported in one 
large implementation project in Tanzania that was conducted in 
280 healthcare facilities in four rural regions with over 1700 women 
with PPH 24.5% ( n = 419) of whom had severe PPH and hypovolemic 
shock.11 Of these women 70.8% received the NASG which indicated 
high utilization and high acceptability. There was also a temporal as -
sociation of a 67% reduced risk of mortality among women with se -
vere PPH during the project (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.16– 0.60).
Use of the NASG is recommended for the clinical stabilization 
and safe transfer to high complexity centers in the clinical scenario 
of PPH. This device is currently used in over 50 countries world -
wide and it has been recommended in many national and interna -
tional guidelines such as GLOWM WHO FIGO and others.12– 15 
This device should be present in every healthcare facility as it has 
proven to be effective and safe granting significant reductions in 
PPH- related mortality.3 15 16 Besides the acceptability demonstrated 
in the Tanzania study qualitative research in a few settings has re -
ported high acceptability from women and providers.11 17– 19

ESCOBAR Et Al.
9.1.3  |  Indications
Women with PPH presenting with clinical signs or laboratory find -
ings compatible with shock or hemodynamic instability are suitable 
for treatment with the NASG. It is important to note that the gar -
ment serves as a temporizing measure. Thus once hemodynamic 
stability is restored patients should receive definitive medical and 
surgical treatment. Table 8 provides a reference for the indications 
for NASG application.3
9.1.4  |  Instructions for use
The NASG is composed of six articulated segments. The first three 
segments are bilateral and independent segments for the lower 
body parts: ankles calves and thighs. The other three circumferen -
tial segments are placed over the pelvic and abdominal areas. It must 
first be unfolded entirely and placed under the patient's body. To 
assure proper application of the garment placement of the superior 
edge of segment 6 (the superior segment) over the lower rib should 
be confirmed. The device can be adjusted to all sizes and heights. For 
instance in shorter patients segment 1 can be folded into segment 
2 to keep the first applied segment at the ankle and it can be per -
formed whenever someone who is competent to insert it is available.For garment applications each segment must be stretched and 
closed as tightly as possible starting at the ankles with segment 1 
and continuing with the remaining segments successively.5 It is im -
portant to try to keep both knees uncovered by the leg segments to 
preserve joint mobility. The leg segments of the NASG can be placed 
by one or two people depending on the availability of healthcare 
personnel. Appliers can use the pubic symphysis as an anatomical 
reference point for placing segment 4. Appliers can use the umbili -
cus as guidance for placing segments 5 and 6. Although all segments 
should be closed firmly and tightly the abdominal section must not 
be closed too tightly in order to maintain adequate respiration. For 
that reason it is advised that only one person should close segments 
5 and 6. If there is more than one person available two people can 
coordinate their actions with one person presenting the opposite 
segment to the person who will close both segments together. If the 
patient shows signs of respiratory distress abdominal segments (5 
and 6) can be loosened but not completely opened.
If the patient requires surgical intervention the leg sections should 
remain closed while the pelvic and abdominal segments can be tem -
porarily opened just before the skin incision is made and then closed 
once the procedure is concluded. In addition a drop in blood pres -
sure should be expected when the abdominal and pelvic segments are 
opened and hence appropriate measures should be taken.
9.1.5  |  Monitoring and removal
Patients using the NASG should be closely followed with continuous 
monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure and optimal fluid resus -
citation.5 This device can be used safely for up to 48 h as a tempo -
rizing measure until hemodynamic stability or adequate hemorrhage 
control is achieved. Nevertheless there are reports of the NASG 
used for longer than 72 h. To safely remove the NASG healthcare 
professionals must verify the following criteria: blood loss <50 ml/h 
heart rate < 100 bpm and systolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg (rule 
of 100’s) for at least 2 h.5 Once the following criteria are corrobo -
rated it is safe to start removing the garment. The intravenous line 
should remain in situ during the removal. Removal should follow the 
same steps as application starting with segment 1 at the ankles and 
moving slowly up to segment 6. Every time a segment is opened a 
15- min period is allowed to re- evaluate vital signs and check for ac -
tive bleeding. If vital signs remain stable and there are no signs of ac -
tive bleeding it is safe to open the next segment. However if systolic 
blood pressure drops ≥20 mm Hg or heart rate increases ≥20 bpm 
(rule of 20’s) or active bleeding is identified all of the segments must 
be rapidly closed again. Once removed the NASG should be placed in 
a biohazard container and sent to be laundered dried and refolded. 
Videos and presentation slides of correct application use removal 
and cleaning can be obtained for free at: www.safem other hood.
ucsf.edu. These instructions must be followed strictly as incorrect 
removal of the garment could result in hemodynamic instability and 
recurrence of shock especially if the abdominal segment is the first 
segment to be opened.5 In the absence of hemodynamic instability TABLE 8  Indications for NASG applicationa

signs the whole garment can be removed in 1 h and 15 min. Routine 
follow- up laboratories including hemoglobin and hematocrit are 
encouraged. Values over 7.5 mg/dl of hemoglobin and a hematocrit 
>23% are recommended; however there is neither consensus nor 
evidence about these values and further research is needed.
9.1.6  |  Adverse effects
Currently no adverse effects have been documented with correct 
implementation of the NASG4; no increase in shock- related organ 
dysfunction adverse effects have been noted.9
9.1.7  |  Contraindications
Currently there are no absolute medical contraindications for NASG 
use.3 Cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities such as heart failure 
severe mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension are considered 
relative contraindications in nonobstetric patients. Although in se-
vere hemorrhage benefits are thought to outweigh any potential 
harm.5

9.2  |  Uterine balloon tamponade
Despite active management of the third stage of labor 2%– 7% of 
women experience postpartum blood loss of more than 500 ml.1 
Uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) is both a diagnostic and thera -
peutic tool. If bleeding does not stop after its insertion then it is 
better to review the etiology of PPH. Placement of a UBT device 
should be considered early when emergency measures for man -
agement of PPH are initiated. It should be performed by compe -
tent healthcare providers who are trained in its insertion to avoid 
complications that can arise from misplacement. Perineal vaginal 
and cervical tears and ruptured uterus must be excluded and the 
placenta carefully assessed for completeness to rule out retained 
fragments of the placenta. First- line emergency interventions for 
atonic PPH include uterine massage initiation of large intravenous BOX 7 FIGO recommends that all healthcare facilities 
have the NASG as an effective nonsurgical device that 
can be used as a temporary measure to recover 
hemodynamic stability for the management and 
transfer of a patient to a high level of care.

access emptying the uterus and bladder and administration of 
oxytocin and TXA (first response bundle). If the uterus fails to 
contract ergometrine or misoprostol should be administered bi -
manual uterine or aortic compression should be initiated a UBT 
placed and the NASG applied (response to refractory PPH bun -
dle).2 These two sets of approaches have recently been defined as 
the “PPH bundle”.3
Observational studies have reported UBT success rates between 
83% and 95% overall with nearly 100% survival among women with 
uncontrolled hemorrhage when a UBT device was placed before the 
onset of advanced shock.4– 6 The integration of UBT into PPH clinical 
pathways in high- income countries has been shown to avert hyster -
ectomy and significantly reduce the need for PPH- related invasive 
procedures such as artery ligation uterine compression sutures and 
arterial embolization.7– 10
A 2020 systematic review and meta- analysis showed an overall 
pooled success rate of 85.9% (95% CI 83.9– 87.9%) for the treatment 
of PPH with higher pooled success rates corresponding to PPH due 
to uterine atony and placenta previa and lower pooled success rates 
for PPH due to placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) and retained prod -
ucts of conception.11 A safety trial in Kenya and Sierra Leone on a 
uniquely designed condom uterine tamponade device (ESM- UBT) 
demonstrated no increased risk of infections or perineal injuries and 
success rates of condom UBT devices appear to be comparable to 
those of Bakri balloons.12 Available UBT devices and specific consid -
erations are described below.
9.2.1  |  Available UBT devices
Uterine balloon devices can be divided into two groups:
1. Fixed volume devices: condom uterine balloons (ESM- UBT kit 
CG balloon) Bakri balloon Rusch balloon and Ebb system.12– 16
2. Free flow devices: the glove balloon Ellavi UBT and Zukovski 
balloon.17– 19 The glove and Ellavi balloons allow intrauterine pres -
sure control according to systolic blood pressure. The Zukovski 
balloon uses 50 cm (3.8 cmHg) pressure for inflating the balloon.
9.2.2  |  Tamponade effect
The mechanism of action of UBT devices is likely multifactorial. Two 
proposed mechanisms include device stimulation of receptors which in 
turn stimulates uterine contraction as well as the direct application of 
hydrostatic pressure against the bleeding sinuses. It has been proposed 
that if uterine wall pressure exerted by a UBT equals the systolic arte -
rial pressure of the bleeding sinuses a tamponade effect is created.14 
However Georgiou20 measured intraluminal pressures in Bakri bal -
loons in two cases where UBTs had been placed and discovered that 
tamponade occurred at UBT device pressures lower than systolic blood 
pressures. Further research is needed to better understand the precise 
biomechanical relationship between a UBT device and a bleeding uterus.9.2.3  |  Free flow tamponade device
Blood is supplied to the uterus via maternal arterial blood that 
passes through the myometrium through low resistance sinuses.21 
Following delivery of the placenta the muscle fibers of the myome -
trium contract and retract closing off the sinuses and limiting blood 
loss. While the immediate aim in PPH due to atonic uterus is to arrest 
blood loss the ultimate goal is to employ best practice interventions 
to facilitate contraction of the myometrium. The surgical glove bal -
loon the Ellavi UBT and the Zukovsky balloon are free flow systems 
that allow water to be expelled from the balloon to theoretically 
better allow for the natural physiological process of contraction and 
retraction of the myometrium once the uterus has recovered.17– 19 
However almost all commercially available UBT devices are low- 
pressure high- volume systems that allow for easy UBT expulsion 
when the uterus regains its tone and begins to contract.
9.2.4  |  Drainage port
The need for a drainage port with a UBT device is questionable.13 14 16 
Drainage ports are only a few millimeters in diameter and there -
fore are easily obstructed by clotted blood. Furthermore since the 
source of bleeding in atonic uterus is from the site of placental im -
plantation which encompasses only about 20% of the uterine cavity 
a drainage port is less likely to be in proximity to the bleeding site.
9.2.5  |  Correct placement
Multiple techniques have been described on the best approach to 
place a UBT device. The approach should in part be determined by 
the device being used (e.g. stiffness of the introducing end and num -
ber of balloons). To ensure that the balloon could engage within the 
area that is actively bleeding all UBTs should be inserted through 
the cervix and positioned to sit in the upper uterine segment. One 
approach includes placing the hand into the uterus and ensuring that 
the fingertips reach the thick anterior and posterior layers of the 
upper segment. The UBT is then fed into the upper segment of the 
uterus with the free hand. When withdrawing the uterine hand the 
tubing is held with the free hand. While the balloon is filled two fin -
gers are held in the vagina below the cervix to prevent inadvertent 
balloon expulsion.
9.2.6  |  Assessment of effect
Multiple studies have shown that women with uncontrolled PPH 
from an atonic uterus will almost universally survive if a UBT device 
is placed in a timely fashion. If UBTs are placed before patients pro -
gress to advanced shock success rates approach 100%.6 However 
studies such as by Dumont et al.22 and Natarajan et al.23 have shown 
that improvised UBTs delays in recognition of PPH and lack of 
 18793479 2022 S1 Downloaded from https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14116 by Cochrane Colombia Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2023].

ESCOBAR Et Al.
action on actual UBT placement may be barriers to improved out -
comes. While different UBT systems may fill to their desired states 
at different rates it is even more important to recognize that impro -
vised and untested UBTs are less often used. Moreover whenever 
they are their use is often delayed they are more difficult to place 
fall out more easily and are associated with overall lower success 
rates.12– 14 17 19 Therefore immediate recognition of PPH and emer -
gency action with a quality UBT device is imperative to save lives.
9.2.7  |  Transfer
Many studies report high rates of hemorrhage control after UBT 
insertion thus rendering transfers unnecessary. Most often incor -
rect diagnosis and misplacement are the cause of UBT failure. If 
bleeding recurs or the patient continues to be unstable after UBT 
insertion then consideration of transfer to higher levels of care 
should be made. Transfer can occur with both fixed- volume bal -
loons and closed- off free- flow balloons but all UBTs must be care -
fully secured to prevent accidental displacement. A transfer plan 
should be in place in all obstetric settings regardless of whether it 
will be needed or not. This is an absolute necessity in PPH bundles.
9.2.8  |  UBT after cesarean delivery
Use of UBTs for hemorrhage control after cesarean delivery is a 
commonly performed technique worldwide but there is scant sup -
porting literature. There are a few reports on successful outcomes 
with use of UBT in placenta previa. It appears that UBT has higher 
success rates in women with PPH after vaginal delivery than after 
cesarean delivery.11 18 24– 26
9.2.9  |  Combining UBT with compression sutures
Placing a UBT after application of uterine compression sutures 
requires control of the amount of pressure exerted in the uterus 
to prevent uterine necrosis. Although uterine necrosis is possible 
following the insertion of compression sutures alone the risk un -
derstandably would increase with pressure exerted from inside the 
uterus when UBT is used additionally. Cases with uterine necro -
sis following insertion of compression sutures have been reported 
with and without UBT.27 28 The surgical glove balloon and the Ellavi 
UBT are UBT devices that allow the intrauterine pressure to be 
controlled by adjusting the height of the intravenous fluid bag or 
supply bag above the patient.17 18 With systolic blood pressure of 
100 mm Hg and the supply bag or intravenous infusion fluid 1.3 m 
above the patient the pressure exerted by the balloon will be 
100 mm Hg. The specific gravity of mercury is 13 times more than 
water. The device used for the balloon must be large enough to be 
inflated with fluid without requiring any expansion pressure. This is 
achieved by using a surgical glove and the Ellavi UBT.17 189.2.10  |  Other uses of UBT
While the use of UBT for uncontrolled PPH is fairly well estab -
lished published case reports and senior leaders in obstetrics and 
gynecology have described successful use of UBTs in other cir -
cumstances such as in molar pregnancy- associated hemorrhage 
placenta accreta retained placenta and in cases of intentional 
vaginal and cervical placement to temporize uncontrolled bleed -
ing from lacerations.29
WHO recently published recommendations regarding use of 
UBT in the context of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth 
in women who do not respond to standard first- line treatment.30 
According to WHO among the prerequisites for use of UBT evi -
dence supports the need for access to surgical intervention and 
blood products as well as the availability of health personnel skilled 
in its use. They recognize that conditions may not be operationalized 
across all clinical settings and that observational studies suggest a 
substantial reduction in the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality 
following uterine balloon tamponade and that further research is 
needed in low- resource settings.

9.3  |  Uterine artery embolization
Since the first report of the successful use of uterine artery emboliza -
tion (UAE) for the treatment of PPH in 1979 success rates have been 
frequently reported at 90%. However unlike the medical and surgi -
cal treatments for PPH no randomized controlled trials regarding its 
effectiveness have been conducted. The decision to perform uterine 
artery embolization in patients with persistent uterine bleeding should 
be made in consultation with an interventional radiologist. Although 
embolization may be considered as the technique of choice for manag -
ing PPH by some authors certain practical issues must be considered.1
Uterine artery embolization has been shown to be effective in 
the treatment of various causes of PPH including placenta accreta: 
Both UAE and uterine artery ligation have reported success rates of 
greater than 90% with low complication rates. If both techniques are 
available embolization is the preferred first choice as it obviates lap -
arotomy. Ligation can be attempted subsequently if embolization is 
unsuccessful. In contrast after an unsuccessful uterine artery ligation 
embolization may be extremely difficult or even impossible leaving 
hysterectomy as the only remaining option. Some cases may require 
hysterectomy because of failure of embolization. UAE has shown to be 
effective in controlling secondary bleeding and the placenta was found 
to gradually decrease in size in all patients. UAE plays an important role 
in managing these patients because it is effective at reducing uteropla -
cental blood flow to further induce thrombosis of the intervillous space 
and to achieve necrosis of the retained placental tissue.2– 7 Selective 
UAE is effective in the control of PPH thus avoiding hysterectomy.
Availability of resources to perform the procedure: A radiologist 
trained in embolization techniques is a prerequisite as is the appro -
priate equipment for vascular intervention. Digital road- mapping 
may be required and the possible complexity means that this proce -
dure can only be performed in a fully equipped X- ray department.8 
The interventional radiologist inserts sheaths into both femoral ar -
teries to deploy a deflated occlusion balloon into each of the internal 
iliac arteries.9 The sheaths are removed and the deflated balloons 
remain in place until after delivery. After the patient has undergone 
a cesarean delivery the interventional radiologist will inflate the 
balloons if needed based on the amount of bleeding. If inflating the

balloons is postponed the balloons may remain in place for up to a 
few days until the patient's providers are certain she will not begin 
to bleed again; the balloons can then be removed.9
UAE has become recognized as a relatively safe technique when 
preserving the patient's fertility is a priority10– 12: Catheterization of 
the uterine arteries with temporary occlusion by endovascular bal -
loon is considered a valid option in the management of patients at 
high risk of bleeding in particular those with a pre- existing diagnosis 
of placenta accreta in patients requesting to preserve their uterus. 
Ojala et al.13 and Badawy14 described a series of cases in patients 
who underwent embolization of the uterine arteries. Catheterization 
averted hysterectomy in close to 80% of cases.
9.3.1  |  Complications
Some studies have documented resumption of menses and even 
pregnancies after the procedure.15 Complications of pelvic embo -
lization for PPH occur at a rate of 8.7%. The most common com -
plication is low- grade fever. Less common complications are pelvic 
infection groin hematoma iliac artery perforation transient buttock 
ischemia transient foot ischemia and bladder gangrene. Lee et al.16 
listed dissection of the uterine arteries hematoma at the puncture 
site paresthesia and lower limb edema as complications.
Currently most PPH cases requiring hysterectomy are related to 
placenta previa.17 . These patients are commonly diagnosed before 
delivery and are usually delivered by elective cesarean delivery. This 
planning may allow increased use of invasive radiological services 
in the management of such cases by inserting the intra- arterial bal -
loons before going to surgery.
9.3.2  |  Implementation of treatment
1. A radiologist trained in embolization techniques is a prerequisite 
as is the appropriate equipment for vascular intervention. Digital 
road- mapping may be required and the possible complexity 
means that this procedure can only be performed in a fully 
equipped X- ray department.8
2. The obstetrics staff and interventional radiologist select the ap -
propriate operative procedure (UAE or cesarean hysterectomy) 
based on the patient's clinical condition and a refractory response 
to conservative medical management.8
3. UAE is preferred for patients who have a stable systolic and dias -
tolic blood pressure or heart rate.REFERENCES

10  | SURGICAL TREATMENT
10.1  |  Uterine compression sutures for PPH
When a decision is made for surgical intervention adequate opera -
tive theatre should be set up with adequate anesthesia surgical and 
nursing staff and blood should be available for transfusion. Upon 
laparotomy bleeding at the surgical site should be minimized by ad -
equate packing to minimize time lost for suturing while active bleed -
ing is ongoing. In all cases the uterus should be fully exteriorized if 
possible. Blood loss should be minimized while fully extending the 
uterus causing vasoconstriction and a tourniquet placed around the 
low segment until surgical compression sutures are successfully ap -
plied.1 This enables the surgical team to use the following described 
methods by applying the uterine compression sutures with a high 
degree of safety. In addition injections of vasopressin at a dose 
of 4 U in 20 ml of saline in the placental bed after removal of the 
placenta may lead to reduced blood loss as well.2 Placement of en -
douterine square hemostatic sutures may also be used to control 
bleeding from the placental bed.3
Hemostatic suturing technique as a second- line strategy for con -
trol of uterine bleeding due to uterine atony is an effortless fast and 
conservative surgical procedure. It can be performed satisfactorily 
after a cesarean delivery or after a vaginal delivery.4 Complications 
related to its application have been identified but there are no re -
ports of deaths related to compression sutures. Complications can 
include uterine synechia or ischemia uterine necrosis 5 intrauterine 
infection 6 and strangulation of the intestinal loop and abdominal 
omentum when nonabsorbable stitches are used 7 but nonabsorb -
able sutures can be used if other types of sutures are not available.
While most births are uncomplicated obstetricians are often 
faced with PPH at the time of vaginal or cesarean delivery.8 9 If ini -
tial management with fundal massage manual uterine compression 
or uterotonics (oxytocin misoprostol methergine or carboprost 
tromethamine) does not adequately reduce bleeding placement of 
compression sutures can be done to slow bleeding and stabilize the 
patient avoid hysterectomy and ultimately reduce maternal mor -
bidity or death. The three most used compression suture techniques 
for PPH are B- Lynch 10 Hayman 11 and Pereira.12 Other compression 
sutures are cited in the literature such as Cho Ouahba Hackethal 
and Massuba.8 If a Bakri balloon is available the obstetrician can 
combine any of these three compression sutures with the placement 
of the balloon to tamponade bleeding. In some instances expedient 
placement of an O’Leary stitch for temporary devascularization of 
the uterine arteries can decrease bleeding and allow additional time 
for placement of the compression sutures. As with the conduct of 
cesarean delivery specific practical issues have to be considered. 
First the obstetrician should be well versed in sterile pelvic vascular 
operative techniques as placement of sutures will occur at the time 
of cesarean delivery or with laparotomy following vaginal delivery 
and PPH. Second since time is critical to reducing maternal blood 
loss an operative team with the technical skills for additional an -
esthesia administration of blood products and surgical assistance is crucial to the success of surgical management. Three commonly 
used compression sutures are described below and existing data are 
summarized on the effectiveness of each compression technique.
10.1.1  |  Commonly used compression sutures for 
managing PPH
The B- Lynch suture was first introduced in 1997 by Christopher 
Lynch to address hemorrhage with open hysterotomy at the time 
of cesarean delivery.10 A suture is placed on the right side of the 
hysterotomy entering at the base of the incision and exiting at the 
top.13 The suture is then carried across the top of the right fundus 
and a posterior stitch is placed with the entrance of the suture at 
the same level of the anterior suture and exiting on the left posterior 
side of the uterus at the level of the uterine incision. Suture is then 
looped over the left fundus and another stitch is placed at the top 
of the left side of the uterine incision and exiting at the base of the 
incision. The suture is then tugged tightly compressing the body of 
the uterus with placement of a surgeon's knot. Following placement 
of the B- Lynch suture the transverse hysterotomy is closed in the 
usual fashion. In the original description of B- Lynch a chromic su -
ture was used. Subsequent case studies have reported successful 
use of a monocryl suture.
Additional options for compression sutures include the 
Hayman and Pereira. In 2002 the Hayman suture was designed to 
be a technically easier alternative to the B- Lynch suture that could 
be placed expediently and not require hysterotomy. The steps for 
placing a Hayman suture include two to four longitudinal (on the 
left and right side of the uterus) sutures that pass directly from 
the anterior uterine wall and through the posterior uterine wall 
and are tied using a surgeon's knot at the fundus. A transverse 
cervicoisthmic suture traversing the anterior and posterior uterine 
walls can be placed to address bleeding from the lower uterine 
segment.
The Pereira compression technique includes five sutures com -
bining two longitudinal sutures with three transverse sutures. The 
advantage of the Pereira sutures is that placement occurs in the 
submucosal region and avoids the endometrial cavity. However at -
tention is needed for correct placement of the transverse sutures to 
prevent damage to the uterine vessels and ureters.
Based on the available literature the success rate of compres -
sion sutures in achieving hemostasis is 76%– 100%.14 To date no 
randomized controlled trials or controlled studies have compared 
the efficacy of the different compression sutures. In the three orig -
inal studies for B- Lynch Hayman and Pereira success rates were 
reported as 100% (5/5 for B- Lynch 3/3 for Hayman and 7/7 for 
Pereira). In a systematic review 14 the overall success rate of com -
pression sutures was reported as 91.7%. Given the broad use of 
compression sutures and the impact on maternal morbidity and 
mortality it is unlikely that a randomized controlled trial to compare 
the efficacy of different compression techniques will be conducted. 
However an observational study comparing the effectiveness of

10.2  |  Uterine artery ligation
Uterine artery ligation has been described for the control of PPH 
since 1960; it is considered a simple fast- performing technique1 and 
one of the most popular fertility- preserving surgical techniques.2 It is an effective management strategy for bleeding control with suc -
cess rates of 42% and 88% described.3– 6
The recent evidence on the effectiveness of uterine artery ligation 
to control bleeding in PPH is centered on case reports mainly asso -
ciated with other techniques and with the use of tranexamic acid.7– 11 
The success rates for the procedure are higher depending on the time 
of the intervention from the beginning of the bleeding the presence 
of coagulopathy and the expertise of the surgeons.12 13 The latest 
Cochrane systematic review of mechanical and surgical interventions 
for treating primary PPH found no controlled clinical trials evaluating 
its effectiveness for uterine artery ligation.14

10.3  |  Bilateral internal iliac artery ligation
Internal iliac artery ligation was first performed by Kelly in 1894 1 
with reported success rates between 40% and 100%.2 3 It reduces 
pelvic blood flow by half and pulse pressure by 85% thereby simu -
lating a venous rather than an arterial circulation and promoting 
hemostasis.1 2 Although this technique provides a rapid and effec -
tive way to control hemorrhage it remains underused because of 
understandable fear of injury to surrounding structures: internal and 
external iliac arteries and ureters2 4 and should only be considered if 
experienced pelvic surgeons are available. Internal iliac artery liga -
tion may avoid the need for hysterectomy in the context of uterine 
atony.2 In addition in cases of traumatic PPH such as uterine rupture 
and extensive genital injuries internal artery ligation clears the op -
erative field and facilitates hysterectomy.2
During the procedure the common iliac artery is identified. 
After dissection the ureter is visualized crossing the common iliac 
artery at its bifurcation. The common iliac artery branches into an 
internal iliac (hypogastric) artery coursing medially and inferiorly 
and the external iliac artery coursing laterally and superiorly. The 
arteries are not infrequently adherent to the underlying veins and 
require appropriate dissection.5 With right- angled forceps a su -
ture is introduced between the artery and the vein and a knot is 
made.4 5
Noteworthy is that even after bilateral internal iliac artery li -
gation the vascular supply to the pelvis is not completely compro -
mised due to the extensive collateral circulation that exists.4 5 The 
revascularization is provided by the deep femoral artery the anas -
tomosis between the medial femoral circumflex and obturator ar -
tery and that between the lateral femoral circumflex and superior 
gluteal artery and the ovarian artery.4 5 Obstetricians ought to be 
more familiar with this procedure as it is an effective and rapid way 
to control PPH.REFERENCES

10.4  |  Hysterectomy
Peripartum hysterectomy is performed in the treatment of PPH 
when all other conventional methods fail to control the bleeding.1 
The prevalence is higher in low- income regions than in high- income 
regions (2.8 and 0.7 per 1000 deliveries respectively).2 The in -
cidence of this procedure has been on the rise increasing by 15% 
in the USA between 1994 and 2007.3 Similarly in Turkey the rate 
has increased from 0.03% in 2000– 2006 to 0.07% in 2007– 2013. 
In most of the studies this was attributed to the increased rates of 
cesarean delivery.1– 5
The most common indications for peripartum hysterectomy are 
placental pathology such as abnormal placentation placenta previa 
and placental abruption (38%) uterine atony (27%) and uterine rup -
ture (26%).2 Peripartum hysterectomy is associated with high rates 
of maternal morbidity and complications due to the need for blood 
transfusions coagulation disorders injury to the urinary tract the 
need for re- exploration in case of persistent bleeding and postop -
erative fever.1
The maternal mortality rate varies according to countries rang -
ing from 0% in Turkey 6 the UK 7 and New Zealand 8 to 3.2% in 
Australia 9 and as high as 11.8% in Nigeria.10

11  | ASSESSMENT AND RESUSCITATION
11.1  |  Damage control resuscitation in PPH
Hemorrhagic shock is the most frequent type of shock in ob -
stetric patients.1 Blood loss exceeding 40% of total blood vol -
ume leads to global hypoxia and metabolic acidosis.2 These 
metabolic complications accompanied by organ hypoperfusion 
trigger an irreversible state of coagulopathy bolstering hemor -
rhage and inducing multiple organ dysfunction and death.3 The 
concept of damage control resuscitation (DCR) was first reported 
by trauma surgeons and its applicability has spread in traumatic 
and nontraumatic scenarios in general surgery orthopedics and 
obstetrics.4 DCR consists of a series of strategies to minimize 
hemorrhage prevent the deadly triad (coagulopathy acidosis and 
hypothermia) and maximize tissue oxygenation. This is achieved 
by a staged surgical approach that minimizes operative time 
counteracting life- threatening conditions and deferring the de-
finitive surgical procedures until normal physiology is restored at 
the intensive care unit (ICU).5– 7
Efforts in DCR are focused on permissive resuscitation by 
blood product transfusion use of massive blood transfusion 
protocols limited use of crystalloids bleeding control (including 
damage control surgery [DCS] and damage control interventional 
radiology [DCIR]) and physiological and biochemical stabilization 
in the ICU.4– 6 DCR is usually reserved for severely injured patients 
who may not survive the surgical efforts to achieve primary re -
pair in the operating room.4 It is evident that this approach can be 
considered only in higher- level care facilities where there is avail -
ability of experienced personnel with 24- h laboratory and blood 
bank services.
The most important aspects of DCS are described below. 
Hypotensive and hemostatic reanimation are discussed in sections 
11.2.1 and 11.2.6 respectively.
11.1.1  |  Decision for damage control surgery
Physiological and metabolic markers have been proposed to 
identify patients that could benefit from DCS.4 Three parameters 
have been described in the literature as significant clinical indica -
tors for early implementation of DCR and DCS8: acidosis (base 
deficit >8) blood loss > 1500 ml and hypothermia (temperature 
<35°C). Other important parameters to consider are systolic 
blood pressure < 70 mm Hg maternal blood pH < 7.1 and persis -
tent bleeding despite several transfusions (defined as 6 units of 
packed red blood cells by some authors7 and > 10 units by oth -
ers4) (Table 9).
Continuous vital sign monitoring and serial monitoring with blood 
gas analysis and body temperature are recommended. Operative 
time and number of blood units transfused are also crucial for DCR 
decision- making.411.1.2  |  Bleeding control
After identifying eligible DCS patients when medical and surgical 
conservative measures to control bleeding fail a sequential four- 
phase approach should be performed.4
Initial laparotomy
The primary objective is hemorrhage control which is achieved 
by an abdominal hysterectomy. The type of hysterectomy to 
be performed depends on the preference and expertise of the 
operator and the clinical condition of the patient; other factors 
such as age cause of hemorrhage hemodynamic stability and 
pelvic anatomy must be considered.9 According to several stud -
ies there are no statistically significant differences between 
total and subtotal hysterectomy in terms of complications blood 
transfusions and ICU admission.9– 11 Subtotal hysterectomy has 
been associated with quicker hemorrhage control and shorter 
operative times hence is the preferred approach over total 
hysterectomy.9 11
The bleeding site must be identified to pick the most suitable 
approach. When the bleeding is in the lower uterine segment 
cervix or vaginal fornices a subtotal hysterectomy may not be 
the most effective approach for hemorrhage control since the ar -
terial circulation of the cervix has a high blood flow rate and could 
cause bleeding persistence. In these cases total hysterectomy is 
preferred.9 10

As in other surgical specialties packing is the cornerstone of 
obstetric DCS.4 7 Pelvic packing should be performed with at least 
7– 10 compresses according to reported experience.2 12 Aside from 
pelvic packing temporary abdominal closure is performed along -
side as a complementary feature of the procedure. The latter can 
be achieved using a negative pressure system like vacuum pack or 
partial closure with a Viaflex bag (Bogota Bag) without the need 
for negative pressure.2 12 Currently there is neither consensus nor 
sufficient evidence regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics in 
patients undergoing DCS with abdominal packing.4 Several surgi -
cal guidelines recommend the administration of a single preopera -
tive dose of broad- spectrum antibiotics which theoretically should 
provide sufficient coverage for aerobic and anaerobic microorgan -
isms.4 13 14 Other experts suggest administration of prophylactic 
broad- spectrum antibiotics every 6– 8 h until the abdominal packing 
is removed. Nevertheless further studies are necessary to provide 
evidence- based recommendations in the obstetric population.7
Resuscitation – ICU
At this stage the patient must be transferred to the ICU to address 
the physiologic derangements of the hemorrhagic patient: coagula -
tion disorders and metabolic abnormalities.6 Interdisciplinary care 
involving the obstetrician and critical care specialist is key for these 
patients as complications could arise at any time.4 It is crucial to ac -
curately quantify the accumulation of blood in the abdominal cavity. 
The optimal device to do so after partial abdominal closure is the 
vacuum pack which allows a more precise quantification of bleeding 
during the postoperative period. In patients without coagulopathy 
the drainage of > 400 ml/h of blood through the vacuum pack repre -
sents an early indication for laparotomy.4
Definitive surgery
After restoring normal physiology it is considered safe to review the 
abdominal cavity. Ideally this should be performed 48– 72 h after the 
initial surgical procedure.4 Patients may require one or more surgical 
interventions depending on the operative findings. In cases where 
further interventions are warranted it is recommended to continue 
with techniques of temporary closure of the abdominal cavity.15
Definitive closure of abdominal wall and cavity
The final stage is the definitive closure of the abdominal wall which 
is performed after all surgeries have been successfully completed 
and all additional damage has been repaired.4
11.1.3  |  Complications
The majority of DCS complications depend on the time of closure 
of the abdominal fascia. It is important to consider that the number 
of reinterventions is directly related to a higher percentage of infec -
tious complications wound dehiscence and abdominal wall closure 
problems.16 The main complications include infection of the surgical 
wound in 28% of cases presence of intra- abdominal collections in 20% and evisceration in 10% of patients.2 Implementation of pro -
phylactic antibiotic therapy could counteract these complications as 
it targets the polybacterial flora present in the female genital tract. 
An interdisciplinary approach could be required in case of complica -
tions derived from injuries secondary to the surgical procedure such 
as urinomas perforations or fistulas among others.17
11.1.4  |  Final objectives in resuscitation
DCR should be maintained as long as there are signs of bleeding and 
coagulopathy. A continuous assessment of the hemodynamic and 
physiological status of the patient is required. Monitoring several 
resuscitation parameters is essential until tissue hypoxia reverts. 
These parameters include pH base deficit lactate hematocrit and 
coagulation— ideally evaluated with conventional laboratory tests 
and point- of- care testing (POCT) of viscoelastic coagulation such 
as thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry 
(ROTEM). In patients with a clinical trend toward improvement the 
decision to perform definitive surgery is appropriate.4

11.2  |  Resuscitation
Once the shock has occurred in PPH it is estimated that the 
mortality of patients will increase dramatically.1– 3 To mitigate 
metabolic complications strategies such as hypotensive fluid re-
suscitation and transfusion protocols have been studied for hemo -
static reanimation.
There are two strategies for fluid resuscitation in patients with 
hemorrhage: the aggressive approach and the hypotensive resusci -
tation approach. Aggressive resuscitation refers to the traditionally 
used strategy in which the key principle is restoring the effective 
circulating blood volume and rapid normalizing of blood pressure 
with administration of large amounts of crystalloids.2 4 Hypotensive 
resuscitation also called permissive hypotension consists of restric -
tive crystalloid resuscitation during the early stages of a hemorrhagic 
shock to maintain lower than normal systolic or mean blood pressure 
sustaining organ perfusion until control of the bleeding occurs.2 5
In contrast hemostatic reanimation is based on early and ag -
gressive blood product replacement transfusing red blood cells 
(PRBC) fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets (PLT) in the same 
proportion as found in circulating blood to correct coagulopathy.6– 8 
Hypotensive resuscitation and hemostatic reanimation are the fun -
damentals for DCR.9 10
11.2.1  |  Hypotensive resuscitation
The concept of hypotensive resuscitation is because administering 
small crystalloid volumes reduces the risk of dilutional coagulopathy and maintaining a lower blood pressure is less likely to disintegrate the 
pre- formed blood clots. Aggressive resuscitation may worsen coagu -
lopathy and hemorrhage by increasing intravascular hydrostatic pres -
sures diluting coagulation factors and inducing more hypothermia 
which results in deterioration of the triad of death.4 10 11 Furthermore 
an excessive rise in blood pressure could also result in higher red 
blood cell loss leading to more hypoxia and acidosis in tissues.4 11
11.2.2  |  Intravenous fluids
Among the initial strategies for reanimation the administration of 
crystalloids in small boluses of 500 ml is recommended.10 Scientific 
evidence recommends the use of balanced crystalloid solutions such 
as Ringer's lactate owing to the risk of hyperchloremic acidosis and 
the worsening of kidney function with chlorine- rich fluids (saline so-
lution).7 This is particularly important for LMICs where saline- based 
solutions are in abundance. After the administration of each bolus 
physicians must assess the clinical status of patients looking for an im -
provement in signs and symptoms of shock resulting from blood loss.10
11.2.3  |  Targeted blood pressure
The difference between aggressive and hypotensive resuscitation 
lies within targeted blood pressure management.4 Mean arterial 
pressure (MAP) represents the perfusion of the majority of organs 
therefore providing the target for clinicians to guide fluid adminis -
tration.11 Hemorrhagic shock animal models have demonstrated a 
positive benefit in survival with MAP between 55– 60 mm Hg dur -
ing active bleeding.10 The European guideline on management of 
major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma recommends 
permissive hypotension with a systolic blood pressure target of 80– 
90 mm Hg (MAP 50– 60 mm Hg) until major bleeding has been con -
trolled (Recommendation Grade 1C).12
11.2.4  |  Aggressive approach and adverse outcomes
During hemorrhagic shock the endothelial glycocalyx becomes thin -
ner and administration of large amounts of crystalloids exacerbates 
this state leading to fluid extravasation that may cause cerebral 
cardiac and pulmonary edema.7 10 11 Third spacing may also lead to 
cardiac dysfunction worsen hemodynamics and decrease kidney 
perfusion. Decreased kidney perfusion occurs because of an in -
crease in intra- abdominal pressure which can additionally result in 
abdominal compartment syndrome.7 11
11.2.5  |  Evidence
Several studies in trauma patients have demonstrated that hy -
potensive resuscitation is correlated with benefits to survival

with significantly lower PRBC and amounts of fluid required; in 
addition there is diminution in the occurrence of multiple organ 
dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome.2 Although 
recent evidence is mostly from trauma studies a cohort study 
of women with PPH showed that the group that received lower 
amounts of fluids had fewer signs of shock with less blood prod -
uct requirements.13 In addition the study showed that increased 
fluid administration leads to decreased concentrations of fibrin -
ogen hemoglobin hematocrit platelet count associated with 
prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time.13 
The study also demonstrated that administration of >4 L of flu -
ids is associated with subsequent bleeding and adverse maternal 
outcomes.14
11.2.6  |  Hemostatic resuscitation
Resuscitation in hemorrhage was classically focused only on the 
administration of fluids and PRBC. The use of FFP PLT and cryo -
precipitate was delayed until coagulopathy was demonstrated in 
paraclinics.7 Hemostatic resuscitation limits the use of crystal -
loids and involves early administration of blood products (not only 
PRBC) making massive transfusion protocols the cornerstone of 
resuscitation.7 10
11.2.7  |  Transfusion ratios
In hemostatic resuscitation PRBC FFP and PLT are applied in a 1:1:1 
ratio due to the resemblance with whole blood and because a “high 
ratio” is related to fewer complications and better patient survival 
outcomes.6 7 10 15 If PRBC is not available then whole blood can be 
used instead in case of massive hemorrhage.
The strongest evidence for massive transfusions comes from the 
Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion 
(PROMTT) and Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma 
Ratios (PROPPR) trials. The PROMTT study evidenced an improve -
ment in mortality in the first 6 h for patients with high ratios of trans -
fusion ( <1:2 vs ≥1:1).16 Moreover a secondary analysis from PROMTT 
revealed that early administration of plasma (first 3 h and within the 
first 3– 6 transfused units) was related to a decrease in mortality at 
24 h and 30 days.17 However the PROPPR study demonstrated that 
patients transfused with a 1:1:1 ratio achieved hemostasis and suf -
fered fewer deaths due to exsanguination at 24 h.18
11.2.8  |  Fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate
In hemorrhages fibrinogen is the first clotting factor to diminish its 
concentrations to critical levels with values of < 200 mg/dl consid -
ered an indication for component replacement.7 10 Achieving specific 
fibrinogen levels is an important target during massive transfusion 
(at least 150– 200 mg/dl in PPH).7Sources for fibrinogen replacement are FFP cryoprecipitate and 
fibrinogen concentrates (which are not widely available). Because fi -
brinogen concentration in FFP is variable and relatively low and its 
administration may dilute the existent fibrinogen most fibrinogen 
replacement is done with cryoprecipitate.12 A unit of cryoprecipitate 
contains 2 g fibrinogen for each 100 ml; thus a unit of cryoprecipi -
tate will increase serum fibrinogen by 10 mg/dl.7 The usual dose of 
cryoprecipitate is 10 units which is estimated to raise serum fibrino-
gen by 100 mg/dl.7 Subsequent doses must be adjusted conforming 
to serum fibrinogen levels.
11.2.9  |  Massive transfusion protocols
As the underlying physiological imbalance and clinical course 
in trauma seem similar to severe PPH massive transfusion pro -
tocols with high ratios utilized for trauma may be useful for 
PPH.19 20 Recommendations for ratios 1:1– 1:2 for transfusions 
are different from previously proposed protocols with ratios of 
6:4:1 or 4:4:1 as in the CMQCC Obstetric Hemorrhage Toolkit 
and from other obstetrics societies.21 ACOG recommends admin -
istration of blood products in 1:1:1 ratio mimicking whole blood 
replacement.22
Massive transfusion means requirements of ≥4 PRBC units 
(some articles considered ≥10 PRBC within 24 h) replacement of 
total blood volume within 24 h or replacement of 50% of blood 
volume within 3 h.10 The protocol for massive transfusion is spe -
cific at each institution but some schemes have been suggested 
in the literature.
Once the massive transfusion protocol has been activated the 
blood bank will send blood products in rounds to the operating or 
labor room. Each round has a specific number of PRBC FFP PLT 
and cryoprecipitate units according to the protocol established in 
the institution.
Typical rounds consist of 6 units PRBC 6 units FFP 6 units PLT or 
1 platelet apheresis and 10 units of cryoprecipitate (Table 10).7 23 24 
Unless inactivated the blood bank will prepare and send the prod -
ucts for rounds 2– 4 successively and if the patient continues bleed -
ing the protocol will start again from round 1.7
It is very important to notify the blood bank as soon as the 
transfusion requirements decrease to stop the preparation of blood 
products.7TABLE 10  Massive transfusion protocol in obstetricsa

11.2.10  |  Adverse outcomes
Although early transfusions are lifesaving and in theory help to 
achieve hemostasis faster thereby decreasing the number of 
blood products administered the application of multiple units 
of blood products could be associated with a higher incidence of 
transfusion- related complications. These complications include hy -
perkalemia hypocalcemia citrate toxicity transfusion- related im -
munomodulation transfusion- related circulatory overload (TACO) 
transfusion- related kidney injury transfusion- related acute lung 
injury (TRALI) (0.1 per 1000 units transfused) transfusion- related

acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (0.19 per 1000 units trans -
fused).22 24 25 Transfusion- related infectious diseases are uncom -
mon (less than 1/100 000– 1 000 000).22 25

ESCOBAR Et Al.
12  | KEY STATEMENTS
 1. Care bundles have been associated with improved patient 
outcomes when adherence is high. The goal of the PPH bun -
dle is to reduce the frequency of severe hemorrhage and 
improve maternal outcomes. There is still a need for good- 
quality research to determine whether the bundle approach 
will ultimately make a difference in saving women's lives from 
PPH.
 2. In recent years new scientific evidence and the availability of 
new technologies have driven important reflections about PPH. 
To guarantee quality of guidelines it is important to update the 
evidence and base recommendations on the best quality stud -
ies available. It is also essential to stimulate production of new 
research on the key themes of PPH to reduce disparities among 
guidelines. PPH guidelines have helped improve the care of 
women around the world and their use should be stimulated in 
all scenarios.
 3. The shock index indicator defined as the ratio of heart rate to 
systolic blood pressure is simple to use. It has better predictive 
ability than other vital signs because it detects acute changes 
in the maternal cardiovascular system and appears as an early 
marker to predict adverse outcomes.
 4. Evidence continues to support oxytocin as the first- line drug in 
the prevention of PPH in all births.
 5. Women with PPH should receive a fixed dose of 1 g tranexamic 
acid in 10 ml (100 mg/ml) intravenously (1 ml/min) as soon as 
possible after delivery and no more than 3 h after birth. A sec -
ond dose of 1 g should be given intravenously if bleeding con -
tinues after 30 min or restarts within 24 h of the first dose. 
Tranexamic acid should be given in addition to usual treatments 
for the management of PPH including medical (uterotonics) 
nonsurgical and surgical interventions regardless of the cause 
of hemorrhage or the mode of delivery.
 6. The nonpneumatic antishock garment (NASG) is an effective 
nonsurgical device that should be in every healthcare facility. 
The NASG when used as a temporizing measure to recover 
hemodynamic stability in the context of PPH decreases mor -
bidity mortality and hypovolemic shock and is of special impor -
tance in LMICs. While considerable research is still necessary to 
improve knowledge on implementation issues professional as -
sociations and national and international guidelines should con -
tinue to encourage NASG use for refractory PPH management.
 7. Uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) is an effective nonsurgical 
technique that when employed rapidly by a properly trained 
person with a proven device in the context of quality PPH care 
(the PPH bundle) improves survival of women with refractory 
PPH. National and international guidelines should include UBT 
use in the management of PPH.
 8. Interventional radiology may be indicated for the prevention 
and treatment of PPH either before delivery in cases of known 
placental abnormalities and implantation or after delivery when 
the patient is hemorrhaging. Prophylactic catheterization of the uterine arteries with embolization can be considered an impor -
tant therapeutic strategy that is safe and effective for reducing 
maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality by controlling blood 
loss.
 9. Regardless of the compression suture chosen obstetricians 
must first quickly recognize the onset of PPH safely admin -
ister uterotonics and place emergent compression sutures 
if needed. In the immediate postoperative period women 
should be monitored for complications such as hematometra 
pyometra and uterine synechiae. Most important is the ability 
of the obstetrician to control bleeding using medical and sur -
gical interventions stabilize the mother and reduce maternal 
morbidity.
 10. PPH is a serious life- threatening obstetric emergency and early 
recognition of this condition results in better outcomes. In cases 
where medical treatment fails to control the bleeding several 
surgical options exist. To date no randomized controlled trials 
have assessed these techniques nor compared the superiority 
of one to another and all the data are based on case reports and 
case series. Moreover the use of these methods largely depends 
on the facilities provided in each institution and on the care pro -
viders’ skills and familiarity with the procedures. Hence an ef -
fort should be exercised for better training of all care providers in 
these life- saving techniques. Future fertility rate following these 
procedures remains underassessed due to the lack of long- term 
follow- up for these cases. In the future more research should 
target these surgical techniques to shy away from the more 
morbid procedures thereby improving maternal and perinatal 
outcomes.
 11. Damage control resuscitation (DCS) is a combination of resuscita -
tion and surgical interventions with the purpose of restoring he -
mostasis and normal physiology. These techniques have proven to 
be applicable in obstetrics with satisfactory results controlling re-
fractory PPH and an overall decreased mortality of critically ill pa -
tients especially in patients in whom conventional treatment can 
be linked to a high risk of failure. DCS is an available therapeutic 
approach for the management of severe PPH thus proper training 
must be widespread to implement this technique.
 12. Basic recommendations for resuscitation in PPH include admin -
istration of crystalloids in small boluses of 500 ml checking clini -
cal signs and looking for its improvement and use of balanced 
crystalloid solutions such as Ringer's lactate which is preferred 
over chlorine- rich solutions. The target blood pressure in hypo-
tensive resuscitation is 80– 90 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure 
or 50– 60 mm Hg for mean blood pressure.
 13. In hemostatic reanimation fewer crystalloids are administered 
and instead transfusional replacement is started earlier with 
high ratios of transfusion (1:1:1). During massive transfusions 
the target for serum fibrinogen is 150– 200 mg/dl and the usual 
dose of cryoprecipitate is 10 units; it is estimated that these will 
raise the serum fibrinogen by 100 mg/dl. The protocol for mas -
sive transfusion is specific at each institution. Physicians should 
be familiar with their hospitals’ protocol and recommendations.

 14. Anyone who attends a birth can be taught simple home- based life- 
saving skills. The evidence- based prevention and management of 
PPH can be achieved with the use of relatively inexpensive drugs. 
Women should be monitored closely during the first hour after de -
livery of the baby and placenta and accurate blood loss measure -
ment should be implemented. Barriers and gaps can be addressed 
through providing an enabling environment through supportive policies designing a formal plan for supplies task shifting strategies 
and use of guidelines and protocols for successful implementation.
 15. Simulation training on how to manage PPH is encouraged and 
each hospital should have a protocol on the management of 
PPH. OBGYN societies should lobby to have the essential medi -
cations that are needed to prevent and treat PPH readily avail -
able in all maternity centers.

Introduction
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is one of
the leading causes of maternal mortality accounting for nearly 20%1of the
295 000 maternal deaths that occurworldwide.
2The most common cause ofPPH is uterine atony 3hence increasing
the use of uteronics for all women duringdelivery has been a key component of

following cesarean delivery.
DATA SOURCES: We searched Ovid MEDLINE Embase Global Index Medicus Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature 
Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for eligible studies pub-
lished until February 2020.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included any randomized or nonrandomized study published in peer-reviewed journals that compared
at least 2 different dosing regimens of intravenous oxytocin for postpartum hemorrhage prevention in women undergoing cesarean
delivery.
METHODS: Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. The primary
outcome was incidence of postpartum hemorrhage /C211000 mL. Other review outcomes included use of additional uterotonics blood loss 
and adverse maternal events. Data were analyzed according to the type of intravenous administration (bolus only infusion only or bolusplus infusion) and total oxytocin dose. A meta-analysis was performed on randomized trials and the results were reported as risk ratios ormean differences with 95% conﬁdence intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluations scalewas used to rate the certainty of evidence. Findings from dose-ﬁnding trials and nonrandomized studies were reported narratively.
RESULTS: A total of 35 studies (7333 women) met our inclusion criteria and included 30 randomized trials and 5 nonrandomized studies.
There were limited data available from the trials for most outcomes and the results were not conclusive. Compared with bolus plus infusion
regimens bolus only regimens probably result in slightly higher mean blood loss (mean difference 52 mL; 95% conﬁdence interval 0.4 e104
mL; moderate certainty). Among the bolus plus infusion regimens initial bolus doses <5 IU may reduce nausea (risk ratio 0.26; 95%
conﬁdence interval 0.11 e0.63; low certainty) when compared with doses of 5 e9 IU. Total oxytocin doses of 5 e9 IU vs total doses of 10 e19
IU may increase the use of additional uterotonics (risk ratio 13.00; 95% conﬁdence interval 1.75 e96.37; low certainty). Effects on other
outcomes were generally inconclusive.
CONCLUSION: There are limited data available for comparisons of IV oxytocin regimens for postpartum hemorrhage prevention following
cesarean delivery. Bolus plus infusion regimens may lead to minor reductions in mean blood loss and initial bolus doses of <5 IU may
minimize nausea. Bolus only regimens of 10 IU vs bolus only regimens of 5 IU may decrease the need for additional uterotonics however 
further comparative trials are required to understand the effects on other key outcomes particularly hypotension.

###2###global efforts to reduce PPH-associated
morbidity and mortality.4
In 2018 the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) recommended that 10 in-ternational units (IU) of oxytocin shouldbe administered to all women duringdelivery irrespective of the mode of de-livery (vaginal or cesarean delivery[CD]).
4This recommendation was
informed by a Cochrane network meta-
analysis of uterotonic agents for PPH
prevention by Gallos et al.5Based on
further evidence from observationalstudies suggesting dose-dependentadverse effects 
4the WHO recommen-
dations speci ﬁed that when used for PPH
prevention during CD 10 IU oxytocinshould be administered as a divided dose
using a smaller initial intravenous (IV)
bolus followed by infusion.
4However 
the WHO Guideline DevelopmentGroup acknowledged that there wasinsufﬁcient evidence from randomized
controlled trials and speci ﬁed that
identifying an optimal IV oxygocinregimen for PPH prophylaxis during CD
was a high research priority.
4
Previous reports have synthesized ev-
idence on oxytocin dosing regimens forPPH prevention during CD however none of these were systematic reviews orwere published nearly a decade ago.
6e8
An up-to-date review and comparisonof studies are important to help guide
clinical practice and address the priority
identi ﬁed by the WHO Guideline
Development Group. The aim of thissystematic review was therefore toidentify and compare IVoxytocin dosingregimens during CD and determinewhether any regimens are superior.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review inaccordance with the Preferred ReportingItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance
9(Appendix
A). We followed a prespeci ﬁed protocol
registered with the International Prospec-tive Register of Systematic Reviews(CRD42020175544) 
10and outlined any
deviations in Appendix B .E t h i c s
approval was not required because thiswas a systematic review of publiclyavailable data.
Eligibility criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) andnonrandomized studies of interventions
(NRSIs) published in peer-reviewed
journals were eligible for inclusionwithout date restrictions. Conferenceabstracts were not included. We includedstudies written in English and thosewritten in other languages if we were ableto obtain adequate translations.Eligible studies were those that
included women who gave birth at anygestational age to a live or stillborn babyvia CD and included both planned andintrapartum CDs. Women were eligibleif they received IV oxytocin for PPHprevention either at or around the thirdstage of labor recognizing that admin-
istration of oxytocin during the third
stage may not be possible or practicalduring a CD particularly during anemergency CD.
Studies comparing at least 2 different
IV dosing regimens of oxytocin duringCD were eligible. Trials with coad-ministered interventions were eligible 
provided that the use of cointerventions
was identical in all trial arms.
Outcomes of interest
We prespeci ﬁed 25 outcomes based on
those used in the WHO recommenda-tions on uterotonics for PPH preven-tion 
4the PPH core outcome set 11and
the 2019 Cochrane network meta-
analysis on uterotonics for PPH pre-vention.
5The primary review outcome
was incidence of PPH /C211000 mL with
secondary outcomes including PPH/C21500 mL maternal death severe
maternal morbidity (intensive care unit[ICU] admissions) severe maternal
morbidity (shock) use of additional
uterotonics satisfactory uterine tone use of surgical or invasive nonsurgicalinterventions blood transfusion meanvolumes of blood loss change in he-moglobin measurements before vs afterbirth any adverse maternal events(including nausea vomiting headache 
hypotension chest pain myocardial
ischemia cardiac arrythmia dyspnea bradycardia tachycardia or waterintoxication) breastfeeding at hospitaldischarge maternal sense of well-being and maternal satisfaction.
Information sources search strategy 
and study selection
A search strategy was developed inconsultation with an informationspecialist ( Supplemental Table 1 ). Be-
tween February 14 2020 and February19 2020 we searched the following 7electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE Embase Global Index Medicus AJOG at a Glance
Why was this study conducted?
The World Health Organization guidelines state that there is insuf ﬁcient evidence
to recommend a speci ﬁc oxytocin dosing regimen to prevent women from
experiencing postpartum hemorrhage following a cesarean delivery. This sys-tematic review was conducted to identify and compare intravenous oxytocindosing regimens administered during cesarean deliveries and to determinewhether any regimens are superior.
Keyﬁndings
We found limited and generally low-quality data for most outcomes and further
research is required. Bolus plus infusion regimens with an initial bolus dose of<5 international units (IU) may have minor bene ﬁts. Bolus only regimens of 10
IU vs 5 IU may decrease the use of additional uterotonics although the effects onadverse events (particularly hypotension) is unknown.
What does this add to what is known?
This study compared data on all oxytocin regimens administered during cesareandelivery for postpartum hemorrhage prevention. It provides valuable informationfor clinical guidelines and future research.ajog.org Systematic Reviews

###3###Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied
Health Literature Cochrane CentralRegister of Controlled Trials ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO Interna-
tional Clinical Trials Registry Platform.Recovered citations were de-duplicatedusing Endnote (Clarivate Analytics Philadelphia PA)
12and imported into
Covidence (Covidence Melbourne 
Australia)13for screening. Each unique
citation was reviewed and independentlyassessed by 2 review authors (L.C.P. E.K.F. and M.C.) for inclusion initiallybased on titles and abstracts and then onthe full-text articles of potentially eligiblecitations. Disagreements were resolved
through discussion or consultation with
another reviewer (J.P .V.). We alsoscreened the reference lists of allincluded studies in addition to thereference list of the Gallos et al
5network
meta-analysis for additional eligiblestudies.
Data extraction and assessment of risk
of biasFor each study 2 reviewers (L.C.P . E.K.F. M.C.) double-extracted data us-ing a predesigned and pretested elec-tronic spreadsheet (Google Sheets). Dataabout the study design year of publica-tion period of recruitment number of
participants maternal age gestational
age primary and secondary review out-comes and potential effect modi ﬁers
(type of CD previous oxytocin admin-istration during childbirth and previousrisk for PPH) were extracted. Disagree-ments between the reviewers at the titleand abstract and full-text stages were
4% and 9% respectively and were
resolved through discussion or consul-tation with another reviewer (J.P.V.). Weattempted to contact the study authorsfor all studies for which further infor-mation was required.
Each included study was assessed for
risk of bias by at least 2 review authors
(L.C.P . E.K.F. M.C.). RCTs were assessed
using the Cochrane Risk Of Bias 2.0(ROB 2.0 Cochrane London UnitedKingdom) tool 
14and NRSIs were
assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions(ROBINS-I Cochrane) tool.
15We made
an explicit judgment about the overallrisk of bias for each included study. In
addition we assessed the risk of bias ofblood loss measurements using a similarapproach to Gallos et al
5(Supplemental
Table 2 ). Extracted data about the re-
view outcomes from RCTs were enteredinto the Review Manager 5 software(Cochrane)
16for the meta-analysis. Data
from NRSIs were reported narratively.
Data synthesis
We identi ﬁed the following 3 types of
studies: comparative RCTs with /C212
arms dose- ﬁnding RCTs and NRSIs.
Comparative randomized controlled trials.
For comparative RCTs we ﬁrst assessed
trial populations and methods usedbetween trials to judge whether theywere suf ﬁciently similar to warrant a
meta-analysis. A random-effects modelwas used to assess all outcomes with >1
trial. Results from dichotomous datawere presented as a summary risk ratio
(RR) with 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CI)
and as mean differences (MDs) forcontinuous data. For all meta-analyseswe used the Grading of Recommenda-tions Assessment Development andEvaluation (GRADE) approach
17to rate
the certainty of evidence as very low low moderate or high using GRADEpro
software (Evidence Prime Inc Ontario 
Canada).
18We planned to assess publi-
cation bias using funnel plots if there were10 or more studies included in the meta-analysis however this was not donebecause of the limited number of studies.
We conducted separate meta-analyses
for (1) type of IV administration (bolus
only infusion only or bolus plus infu-
sion) and (2) total oxytocin doseadministered. We calculated the totaloxytocin dose for each trial arm byadding all preplanned doses of oxytocindescribed in the study methods including any doses used in a bolus short infusion and maintenance infu-
sion (studies were not included for
analysis of total oxytocin dose if therewas insuf ﬁcient information to deter-
mine the total dose). Considering theavailable evidence (and to standardizethe analyses) trial arms were groupedinto 5 total oxytocin dose categories ( <5
IU 5e9I U 1 0 e19 IU 20 e49 IU and/C2150 IU) for comparison in pairwise
analyses. In addition among trials usingbolus plus infusion regimens we iden-tiﬁed trials that studied the effects of
using different initial bolus doses byvarying the initial bolus dose whilekeeping the infusion component iden-tical between trial arms. Hence we also
analyzed (3) the effects of different initial
bolus doses among trials using bolusplus infusion regimens. To accomplishthis we grouped the initial bolus doses as<5 IU 5 IU or 10 IU for comparison in
pairwise analyses.
In line with the 2019 international
consensus statement recommendation of
a 2- to 4-hour maintenance infusion 
8we
performed a subgroup analysis on studiesthat used a maintenance infusion be-tween 2 and 4 hours only. Owing tolimited available data we were only ableto perform this for the analysis of initialbolus doses in a bolus plus infusionregimen.
We planned to conduct subgroup
analyses by type of CD (planned vsintrapartum) previous oxytocin admin-istration and previous risk of PPH however these were not possible becauseof limited available data. We performedsensitivity analyses for risk of bias (onlyincluding studies with an overall low risk
of bias) and method of blood loss esti-
mation (only including studies that usedcalculated or volumetric assessment ofblood loss). When making statements onthe effects of an intervention we adoptedstandardized language derived from San-tesso et al.
19
Dose- ﬁnding trials and nonrandomized
studies.The dose- ﬁnding RCTs used a 1-arm up-
and-down sequential allocation methodin which the oxytocin dose for the nextparticipant was adjusted according to theresponse of the preceding participant.
20
For example if the ﬁrst participant had
a satisfactory response the next partici-
pant was allocated either an equal orlower dose using a biased-coin technique.Dose- ﬁnding trials did not make explicit 
pairwise comparisons between dosingregimens hence ﬁndings from these trials
were reported narratively. Eligible NRSIswere also reported narratively.Systematic Reviews ajog.org

###4###Results
Study selection and characteristics
The results of the search are summarizedin the PRISMA ﬂow diagram ( Figure 1 ).
We identi ﬁed 9631 records of which
6626 records were excluded at the title
and abstract screening stage and 195 at
the full-text review stage. The mostcommon reasons for exclusion wereduplicate study (n ¼72) and wrong
article type (n ¼37). No further articles
were identi ﬁed through screening of the
reference lists. In total 35 studies of 7333women were included. We found 30
RCTs of which 26 were comparative
RCTs and 4 were dose- ﬁnding RCTs. We
found 5 NRSIs of which 4 werecomparative and 1 was a dose- ﬁnding
study. A summary of the study charac-teristics and an overview of study com-parisons are provided in Tables 1 to 4
andSupplemental Table 3 . Among the 26
comparative RCTs included 9 were at an
overall high risk for bias and 15 were atlow risk for bias ( Supplemental Figures 1
and 2); the 4 dose- ﬁnding RCTs were
assessed to be at an overall high risk forbias. Of the 5 NRSIs 2 were assessed tobe at an overall critical risk of bias andthe remaining 3 as at moderate risk
(Supplemental Figures 3 and4).
Comparative randomized controlled
trialsWe identi ﬁed 26 comparative RCTs (64
trial arms) that included 5271 women.Of these 19 RCTs were 2-arm trials and7 RCTs were multi-arm trials (rangingfrom 3e6 arms). Sample sizes ranged
from 28 e2069 women and 23 trials
included women undergoing planned
CD only. The types of IVadministrationsused were bolus only (14 arms) infusiononly (23 arms) and bolus plus infusion(27 arms). There were 26 different totaldoses of oxytocin used ranging from 1IUe260 IU. The most common total
doses were 5 IU (11 arms) and 10 IU (8
arms). We could not calculate the total
dose for 3 of the studies.
25 27 35Among
those trial arms that used an infusioncomponent the total infusion durationranged from 5 minutes to 24 hours andthe rate of oxytocin administration var-ied from 0.7 IU per hour to 120 IU perhour. Among the 5 trials that compareddifferent initial bolus doses within a
bolus plus infusion regimen the initial
bolus doses ranged from 0.5 e10 IU.
Dose- ﬁnding trials and
nonrandomized studiesWe identi ﬁed 4 dose- ﬁnding RCTs (180
women). The sample sizes ranged from30e70 women. Two trials included
women undergoing planned CD only
and 1 trial included women undergoingintrapartum CD only. All studies usedeither an initial bolus or infusion fol-lowed by a maintenance infusion. Wefound 5 NRSIs that included 1840women with sample sizes ranging from41e1122 women. Of these 4 werecomparative studies (3 2-arm studies 1
3-arm study) and 1 was a dose- ﬁnding
study. The most common type of IVadministration was bolus only (4 arms).Doses ranged from 3 e80 IU with the
most common dose being 5 IU (2 arms).
Outcomes
The most commonly reported outcomes
were the use of additional uterotonics
(28 studies) and mean blood loss (20studies). No data were available for 7outcomes (maternal deaths ICU ad-missions shock water intoxication breastfeeding after discharge maternalsense of well-being and maternal senseof satisfaction ( Supplemental Table 4 ).FIGURE 1

###9###Synthesis of results
Meta-analysis.
Type of intravenous administration. A
total of 15 RCTs (3921 women)compared different types of IV admin-istration regimens ( Table 2 
Supplemental Table 5 ). The incidence of
PPH/C211000 mL was only reported for 1
comparison (bolus only vs bolus plusinfusion).
Bolus only vs infusion only. In 5 RCTs
(338 women) bolus only regimens werecompared with infusion only regimens.No study reported on the outcome ofincidence of PPH /C211000 mL. The effects
of either dosing regimen on the use ofadditional uterotonics mean blood loss or maternal adverse effects (nausea 
vomiting chest pain and myocardial
ischemia) are inconclusive because thecertainty of evidence was very low. Noother outcomes were reported.
Bolus only vs bolus plus infusion. In 5
RCTs (4580 women) bolus only regi-mens were compared with bolus plusinfusion regimens. The effect of either
dosing regimen on the outcome of
incidence of PPH /C211000 mL was
inconclusive because the certainty ofevidence was very low (4 trials of 2976women; RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.75 e2.76;
very low certainty) although bolus onlyregimens slightly increased the meanblood loss (5 trials of 3068 women; MD 
52 mL; 95% CI 0.4 e104 mL; moderate
certainty) ( Figure 2 ) and decreased the
incidence of satisfactory uterine tone (1trial of 145 women; RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.41e0.95; low certainty) ( Figure 3 ).
There were no clear differences in themean change in hemoglobin (3 trials of
2260 women; MD e0.05 g/dL; 95% CI 
e0.27 to 0.17 g/dL; high certainty) or
incidence of blood transfusion (3 trialsof 2870 women; RR 1.55; 95% CI 0.47e5.13; low certainty). The effects of
either dosing regimen on the outcomesof incidence of PPH /C21500 mL use of
additional uterotonics and maternaladverse effects (hypotension nausea 
and chest pain) were inconclusive
because the certainty of evidence wasvery low. There were zero events re-ported for surgical or nonsurgical in-terventions vomiting bradycardia tachycardia and dyspnea. A sensitivityanalysis on risk of bias (including onlystudies at an overall low risk of bias)
suggested no clear difference in mean
blood loss.
Infusion only vs bolus plus infusion. In
5 RCTs (442 women) infusion onlyregimens were compared with bolusplus infusion regimens. No study re-ported on the outcome of incidence ofPPH/C211000 mL. There were no clear
differences in the incidence of satisfac-

adverse events (vomiting [1 trial of 60women; RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.06 e4.18;

tainty] and tachycardia [1 trial of 143
women; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.06 e15.04;
low certainty]). The effects on use ofadditional uterotonics mean bloodloss and nausea were inconclusivebecause the certainty of evidence wasvery low. There were zero events re-ported for surgical interventions chestpain and dyspnea.
Total oxytocin dose. A total of 17 RCTs
(4663 women) compared different totaloxytocin doses ( Table 3 Supplemental
Table 6 ). The outcome of the incidence
of PPH
/C211000 mL was reported for 2
comparisons ( <5I Uv s5 e9 IU and 5 e9
IU vs 20 e49 IU).
Total oxytocin dose of <5I Uv s5 e9
IU.One RCT40(145 women) compared
a total oxytocin dose of <5 IU with 5 e9
IU. It reported zero incidences of PPH/C211000 mL with either dosing regimen.
The effects on the use of additionaluterotonics satisfactory uterine tone mean blood loss or maternal adverseevents (nausea hypotension chest pain)
were inconclusive because the certainty
of evidence was very low. There werezero events reported for blood trans-fusions vomiting bradycardia tachy-cardia and dyspnea.
Total oxytocin dose of 5 e9I Uv s1 0 e19
IU.Three RCTs (177 women) compared
a total oxytocin dose of 5 e9 IU with
10e19 IU. No study reported on the
incidence of PPH /C211000 mL. The use of
a total dose of 5 e9I Uv s1 0 e19 IU may
result in a large increase in the use ofadditional uterotonics (2 trials of 137women; RR 13.00; 95% CI 1.75 e96.37;TABLE 4

clear difference in myocardial ischemia(1 trial of 103 women; RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.14e6.70; low certainty). The effect on
mean blood loss was inconclusive
because the certainty of evidence wasvery low. There were zero events re-ported for hypotension.
Total oxytocin dose of 5 e9I Uv s2 0 e49
IU.Four RCTs (2996 women) 
compared a total oxytocin dose of5e9I Uw i t h2 0 e49 IU. The effects of
either dosing regimen on the out-
comes of incidence of PPH /C211000
mL PPH /C21500 mL use of additional
uterotonics or blood transfusion ormean blood loss were inconclusivebecause the certainty of evidence wasvery low. There was no clear differ-ence in the change in hemoglobin
(3 trials of 2260 women; MD e0.05
g/dL; 95% CI e0.27 to 0.17 g/dL; low
certainty).
Total oxytocin dose of 10 e19 IU vs
20e49 IU. Two RCTs (331 women)
compared a total oxytocin dose of 10 e19
IU with 20 e49 IU. Neither
study reported on the incidence of PPH
/C211000 mL. The use of a total dose of
10e19 IU compared with of 20 e49 IUprobably reduces chest pain (1 trial of
271 women; RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00e0.81; moderate certainty)
(Supplemental Figure 5 ). There were no
clear differences in the incidence of
blood transfusion (1 trial of 271 women;RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.28 e2.62; low cer-
tainty) satisfactory uterine tone (1 trialof 271 women; RR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00e1.09; moderate certainty) or
tachycardia (1 trial of 271 women; RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.26 e2.69). The effects on
the use of additional uterotonics mean
blood loss nausea or vomiting wereinconclusive because the certainty ofevidence was very low.
Total oxytocin dose of 20 e49 IU vs /C2150
IU.One RCT
36(321 women) compared
a total oxytocin dose of 20 e49 IU with
/C2150 IU. It did not report on the inci-
dence of PPH /C211000 mL. The use of
doses of 20 e49 IU compared with /C2150
IU may increase the use of additionaluterotonics (RR 2.07; 95% CI 1.42e3.01; low certainty) ( Supplemental
Figure 6 ). There were no clear differ-
ences in mean blood loss (MD 20 mL;95% CI e14 to 54 mL; low certainty) or
hypotension (RR 1.05; 95% CI 
0.71e1.53; low certainty).Different bolus doses in bolus plus infusion
regimens. A total of 5 RCTs using
oxytocin regimens of bolus plus infusion(357 women) compared different initial
bolus doses while keeping the infusion
component identical for both trial arms(Table 4 Supplemental Table 7 ).
Initial bolus dose of <5 IU vs 5 IU in a
bolus plus infusion regimen. In 3 RCTs
(180 women) in which a bolus plusinfusion regimen was used an initialbolus dose of <5 IU was compared with
that of 5 IU. No study reported on the
incidence of PPH /C211000 mL. Data from
all 3 trials showed that initial bolus dosesof<5 IU may reduce nausea (RR 0.29;
95% CI 0.10 e0.81; low certainty)
(Supplemental Figure 7 ) but there were
no clear differences in the use of addi-tional uterotonics (RR 1.08; 95% CI 
0.51e2.31; low certainty) or vomiting
(RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05 e1.04; low cer-
tainty). The effect on mean blood losswas very uncertain owing to very lowcertainty about the evidence. There werezero events reported for surgical ornonsurgical interventions blood trans-fusions and maternal adverse events
(chest pain cardiac arrythmia dyspnea 
hypotension).FIGURE 2

###11###Initial bolus dose of 5 IU vs 10 IU in a
bolus plus infusion regimen. One RCT24
(87 women) that employed a bolus plus
infusion regimen compared an initialbolus dose of 5 IU with 10 IU. It did notreport on the incidence of PPH /C211000
mL and there were no clear differences in
mean blood loss (MD 2 mL; 95% CI 
e135 to 138 mL; low certainty) cardiac
arrythmia (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.01 e8.14;
low certainty) or chest pain (RR 0.41;95% CI 0.08 e2.00; low certainty). There
were zero events reported for surgical ornonsurgical interventions and dyspnea.
We were largely unable to perform
sensitivity and subgroup analyses owing
to limited available data. However wheredata permitted these analyses no sig-niﬁcant effects were found except where
otherwise described.
Narrative synthesis.
We reviewed dose- ﬁnding RCTs and
NRSIs separately. Findings from thesestudies are inconclusive however wereport the main ﬁndings below. The re-
sults were not reported as statistically
signiﬁcant unless otherwise noted.
Dose- ﬁnding studies. A total of 4 dose-
ﬁnding RCTs (180 women) studied the
different initial doses required to initiateuterine contraction when followed by amaintenance infusion. No study re-ported on the incidence of PPH /C211000
mL. The studies found that small doses
(0.3 IU as a bolus or 0.27 e0.29 IU/min
as a short infusion) may be adequate toprevent uterine atony during plannedCD
48e50and that higher doses of
oxytocin may be required during intra-partum CD regardless of the type ofadministration.
47 50One dose- ﬁnding
NRSI55(83 women) reported that small
doses (1 IU as a bolus) may be adequateto prevent uterine atony with higher
doses needed during intrapartum CD.
Hypotension secondary to oxytocinadministration was noted in all studies however was not explored in relation tospeciﬁc doses or types of IV adminis-
tration regimens.Nonrandomized studies.Type of intravenous administration. One
study
52(1122 women critical risk of bias)
compared bolus only with bolus plusinfusion regimens. It suggested that morewomen who received bolus only regi-mens experienced PPH /C211000 mL than
women who received bolus plus infusionregimens greater use of additional ute-rotonics and increased incidence in
blood transfusions. There were no sig-
niﬁcant differences reported for any other
outcomes.
52Another study53(454
women moderate risk of bias) comparedinfusion only with bolus plus infusionregimens. It did not report on the inci-dence of PPH /C211000 mL but suggested
that women who received infusion only
regimens experienced a greater overall
decrease in hemoglobin levels.
Total oxytocin dose. One study
54(73
women moderate risk of bias)compared a total oxytocin dose of 3 IUwith that of 5 IU. It did not report on theincidence of PPH /C211000 mL butsuggested more women who received 5
IU experienced vomiting whencompared with women who received 3IU. One study
52(1122 women critical
risk of bias) compared a total oxytocindose of 5 IU with that of 10 IU and 15 IU.It suggested that increased doses of
oxytocin may result in less PPH /C211000
mL the use of additional uterotonics andblood transfusions and may lead tomore satisfactory uterine tone.
52One
study51(150 women critical risk of bias)
compared a total oxytocin dose of 30 IUwith that of 80 IU. It did not report onthe incidence of PPH /C211000 mL but
suggested that 30 IU may lead to a sta-
tistically signi ﬁcant increase in the use of
additional uterotonics and a decrease insatisfactory uterine tone. No signi ﬁcant
differences were reported for any otheroutcomes including hypotension.
Comment
Main ﬁndings
We identi ﬁed 35 studies of 7333 women
comparing different IV oxytocin regi-mens for PPH prevention following CD.The evidence in general was limited anddata were lacking for most of the reviewoutcomes with the data from 11 studiesat high or critical risk of bias. We did not
ﬁnd any clear differences in the incidence
of PPH /C211000 mL although data were
sparse for this outcome. Bolus plusinfusion regimens are possibly superiorto bolus only regimens in terms of asmall reduction in mean blood loss(around 52 mL) and increased uterineFIGURE 4

###12###tone although these ﬁndings were based
on a few trials. In general we found noclear indication of a superior totaloxytocin dose (largely because of insuf-ﬁcient evidence). Although we found
doses of 10 e19 IU is possibly better than
doses of 5 e9 IU in terms of decreasing
the use of additional uterotonics there
were limited data on adverse maternal
events (particularly hypotension). Ofinterest both studies used in the meta-analysis of this outcome exclusivelycompared 5 IU with 10 IU in a bolus onlyregimen.
Oxytocin regimens were described
using varying time intervals which
complicated meaningful comparison.
However available evidence suggeststhat when administering oxytocin in abolus plus infusion regimen initial bolusdoses of <5 IU may lead to less nausea 
but the effects of lower vs higher initialbolus doses on blood loss are not known.The infusion component of bolus plus
infusion regimens most commonly
continued for 2 e4 hours.
Findings from nonrandomized
studies although not conclusive owingto a greater susceptibility to bias werebroadly consistent with the ﬁndings of
meta-analyses on RCTs. These generallyindicated that bolus plus infusion regi-
mens may be superior to bolus only
regimens and that higher oxytocin dosesmay be more effective but can increaseadverse maternal events. Among thebolus plus infusion regimens 4 dose-ﬁnding RCTs reported that small initial
doses (0.3 IU as a bolus or 0.27 e0.29 IU/
min as a short infusion) may be adequate
to prevent uterine atony during planned
CD 
48e50with higher doses required at
intrapartum CD 47 50but the evidence
was not conclusive and should be inter-preted with caution.
Comparison with existing literature
Ourﬁndings are broadly consistent with
previous work on IV oxytocin dosing
regimens for PPH prevention followingat CD including a 2012 systematic re-view
7of 7 RCTs (626 women) and a 2011
literature review.6Both reviews recom-
mended the use of a small initial bolusdose (ranging between 0.3 and 3 IU)
6 7
with 1 review further recommending abolus plus infusion regimen.7Both re-
views further reported more adversehemodynamic events with higher dosesof oxytocin which is consistent with ourﬁndings. Our ﬁndings are compatible
with a 2019 international consensusstatement 
8which recommends using a 1
IU bolus followed by a 2.5 e7.5 IU/h
infusion over 2 e4 hours and the WHO
recommendation of 10 IU oxytocinadministered IVor intramuscular duringall births with doses divided into a smallinitial IV bolus with subsequent infusionduring CD.
4However it is evident that
good-quality trials comparing differentoxytocin dosing regimens are needed to
guide practice. It is noteworthy to
mention that national guidelines vary(Supplemental Table 8 ) probably
reﬂecting the lack of clear evidence to
guide practice. The 2017 AmericanCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-gists guidelines recommend using adilute IV infusion (bolus dose of 10 IU)
for PPH prevention without speci ﬁca-
tion for mode of delivery.
57Australian
guidelines only recommend prophylac-tic oxytocin for all births without speci-fying a dosing regimen.
61Carbetocin is
recommended in Canada during plan-ned CD 
60and a bolus only oxytocin
regimen is recommended in the United
Kingdom.58French guidelines recom-
mend a oxytocin bolus plus infusionregimen during CD however suggest aninitial bolus dose of 5 e10 IU.

Strengths and limitations
We used a systematic and methodologi-cally robust approach to searching and
analyzing literature without date or
language restrictions. We included bothrandomized and nonrandomizedstudies which allowed for a more thor-ough and nuanced investigation ofoxytocin dosing regimens. We also pre-speciﬁed outcomes that aligned with
WHO priority outcomes
4and the PPH
core outcome set11and used the latest
and more sophisticated iterations of theCochrane risk of bias tools (ROB 2.0 andROBINS-I).
14 15
Despite this evidence was generally
limited for most outcomes. In a networkmeta-analysis by Gallos et al
5in which
different uterotonic options werecompared the authors similarly
described inadequate reporting ofadverse events in trials of uterotonics forPPH prevention.
5The international
consensus statement by Heesen et al8
also called for further large studies onthis topic.
8Any such trials should be
sufﬁciently powered for important
health-related outcomes and should
clearly specify the dosing regimen. Spe-ciﬁcally trials comparing different
oxytocin doses of bolus plus infusionregimens should be conducted. Weconsider it particularly important thatfuture trials should report on theoutcome of PPH /C211000 mL an impor-
tant outcome for clinical guideline de-
cision making.
We also found hypotension to be a
poorly studied outcome despite dose-dependent hypotension being welldescribed.
21 29 42 46 62Among RCTs the
effects of different dosing regimens onhypotension were generally either
inconclusive or equivocal. No NRSI re-
ported signi ﬁcant differences in the
incidence of hypotension. However itwould not seem unreasonable to expectan increased incidence of hypotensionwith higher doses (particularly withbolus regimens) and it is likely that thecombination of a bolus plus infusion
regimen allows doses to exceed 5 IU
while avoiding signi ﬁcant hemodynamic
instability. Indeed we consider itparticularly important to prioritizeresearch in this area.
We also did not ﬁnd any clear evidence
of diminishing returns from increasingdoses and/or longer time periods of
infusion despite it also being well
described.
22 26Again this was largely
because of lack of good-quality data andis an area for which further research isrequired.
We identi ﬁed a wide range of dosing
regimens that added to the complexity ofthis analysis and likely contributed to
high heterogeneity. Although we aimed
to standardize comparisons by usingtotal oxytocin dose we were not able toaccount for other factors such as rate ofoxytocin administration or total infu-sion time. We acknowledge that our dosecategories are somewhat arbitrary although necessary to standardize andajog.org Systematic Reviews

minimize the effect of subjective judg-ments on blood loss by including this inour risk of bias assessment and per-forming sensitivity analyses.
Finally the majority of studies
included only women undergoing plan-ned CD with low risk of PPH. Hence 
these ﬁndings may not be generalizable
to other higher-risk groups of womenwho may require a different oxytocinregimen.
Conclusions and implications
Based on current evidence the mostappropriate oxytocin regimen may be
bolus plus infusion and an initial bolus
of<5 IU although further trials are
needed to con ﬁrm these conclusions.
Bolus only regimens of 10 IU vs 5 IU maydecrease the use of additional utero-tonics however further research isrequired to understand the implicationson adverse events particularly hypoten-
sion. In the absence of more robust evi-
dence many current guidelines on PPHprevention following CD may warrantreconsideration. Further research isrequired particularly in women at highrisk for PPH for other important out-comes such as adverse maternal events breastfeeding and maternal well-being
and satisfaction.
Final conclusion
This systematic review and meta-
analysis of IV oxytocin dosing regimensfor PPH prevention during CDs identi-ﬁed a lack of data for several important
outcomes. Future well-designed studiesare required to identify an optimaloxytocin dosing regimen for womenundergoing CD. Nevertheless available
data suggest that an IV bolus plus infu-
sion regimen with an initial bolus doseof<5 IU may be preferable. However 
the degree of certainty for the evidencewas generally low and further research isrequired to identify the optimal oxytocinregimen for PPH prevention duringCDs.

Deviations from protocol

Primary outcomes: PPH /C21500 mL and PPH /C211000 mL PPH /C21500 mL downgraded from primary outcome to
secondary outcomeWe opted to downgrade PPH /C21500 mL from a primary
to a secondary outcome considering that the deﬁnitionof PPH after CD is PPH /C211000 mL (as distinct from PPH
after vaginal birth).
Included dyspnea and chest pain as additional
secondary outcomesAdditional adverse events reported in some trials.
Include only third stage administration of oxytocin Included administration of oxytocin at or around third
stagePracticality considerations means oxytocin not always
able to be delivered at third stage during CD.
Random-effects model if I
2>30% Random-effects model for all analyses with >1 trial Given large heterogeneity of trials and as per Cochrane
handbook random-effects model provided a more
conservative estimate.
Speciﬁc comparisons made between high dose vs low
dose bolus and high dose vs low dose infusionWe further divided the comparison of studies into (1)
type of IV administration and (2) total oxytocin doseusing the categories of <5 IU 5e9 IU 10e19 IU 
20e49 IU /C2150 IU. Among studies comparing a bolus
plus infusion regimen we further compared various
initial bolus doses when followed by an infusion.The wide range of oxytocin regimens identiﬁed meant
that our original approach of high and low dose was notpractical nor informative.

Sensitivity analysis of risk of bias included studies only at overall low risk of bias.
Sensitivity analysis of method of blood loss measurement included studies only at low risk of bias for that domain.Subgroup analysis included only studies using a bolus plus infusion regimen for which the infusion duration ranged between 2 to 4 hours.GRADE working group grades of evidence were as follows:
High certainty: we are very conﬁdent that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate certainty: we are moderately conﬁdent in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
Low certainty: our conﬁdence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.Very low certainty: we have very little conﬁdence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of e ffect.
